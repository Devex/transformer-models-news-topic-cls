29186,"Development jobs in Peru: What you need to know It was pouring, thundering, and lightning. Gillian Cassell-Stiga and Carrie Golden were on the back of a flatbed truck, sliding down the mountains outside of Cusco, Peru. Only a tarp sheltered them from the storm. It was impossible to see anything under the tarp, but they could feel the truck slipping and sliding down the narrow mountain road. “We thought we were going to fly off the road at every turn,” Cassell said. When she dared to look out, she just saw the drop, and went back immediately under the tarp. “Better not to look! Better not to look!” she screamed. The two women, recent graduates from American universities, were stranded in a small Cusco community after a day of work at a local school. They were working for GirlSportsWork, a California-based nongovernmental organization that runs academic and athletic programs for girls in rural Cusco. By the time they saw the black rain clouds coming their way, it was too late. It started pouring. Soaked and freezing, they had not brought blankets or clothes to spend the night in town, they had to go down to Cusco. But combis - small vans used for public transportation throughout Peru - would not run under these conditions. Cassell and Golden were lucky that the flatbed came along. They were relieved when they reached Cusco and could emerge from under the tarp. “You would hear all these stories about the terrible roads,” Cassell said. “But that was not our day.” Peru’s topography Peru features a variety of climates. Temperature in the highlands varies with altitude - the higher the land the colder the weather, especially at night. There are different rainy seasons for the coast, the mountains, and the rainforest - the country’s most distinct geographic regions. However, it rarely rains along the coast, especially in Lima. High in the Andes, the city of Cusco is the most popular tourist destination in Peru. It is very different from Lima, both in climate and general atmosphere. But besides its touristy feel, the Cusco region is also a hub for various development organizations, research institutions, and charities. There are plenty of volunteer, research and internship opportunities. Additionally, one of the largest natural gas deposits in Latin America, known as Camisea, is in the high forests of Cusco. This project has attracted important environmental NGOs, consulting firms, and civil society organizations. There are no international flights to Cusco, as the country’s only international airport is located in Lima. For people going to work in the Cusco area, Cassell warns against taking the buses from Lima. The trip takes almost a whole day, and you will likely spend another day recovering from the trip. Altitude, winding roads, high temperatures, no air conditioning, plus closed windows can make for a very uncomfortable ride. If you decide to take a bus anyway, you will not regret paying for the most expensive one, as service varies greatly in quality and safety. For a few extra dollars, however, you can fly out from Lima, and see the Andes from above. The flight takes about an hour and the view is well worth it. What to bring Once in Cusco, or anywhere in Peru, Cassell recommends taking advantage of the relationships expats can make with local people. Locals can show you the things you will never see on fancy tours. “Figure out your own way,” she said. And do not bring high heels, as all the streets are cobblestone in Cusco. Lindsey Parramore, a former Peace Corps volunteer who worked in the northern coast and central sierra of Peru until 2006, would agree, although for different reasons. “Do not take very many material possessions,” she said. Some people in Peru, especially in small towns and rural areas, tend to think that all foreigners are rich. Depending on where you are, it is advisable to keep a low profile, wear basic clothes, and to not let everybody know you brought your digital camera, your iPod, or your laptop. Crime happens in Peru, and drawing as little attention to yourself as possible will help avoid a bad experience. “Just be very simple,” Parramore said. It is always good to have some company when you are out, especially for people who work in rural areas or urban barrios where there are fewer police officers. According to Parramore, this can be a good idea even for business meetings. She would often have to meet with mayors or local politicians of small towns - mostly men - in order to obtain authorization to implement certain community development projects. At times she said she felt uncomfortable because “they cared more about personal things as opposed to things that were business.” But one also has to consider that “Peruvians are a gregarious bunch,” as Houng Sonia Diep put it. Diep served as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Anchash region in 2004-2005 and returned to Peru as a consultant through a Denver university. “They like to talk. They like people who make jokes, and they like to work hard, and play hard,” she said. Parramore also noted that bringing a written document to the authorities could be very helpful. “Almost always they needed something in writing,” she said. If it is written, then it has to be important, seemed to be the logic. Wrap your request in a document or letter, “sign it, seal it, make it official; otherwise they might not take you seriously,” she said. And be ready to wait. Time and language Peruvians have different perceptions of time, even when it comes to business matters. Of course, it is not fair to make generalizations, as consulting firms and legal offices in an upscale Lima neighborhood operate very differently than public bureaucrats and small community organizations in the provinces. “There are those who are bothered by lateness and others who appreciate it,” said Lizzie Towl, a British Latin American who worked for a large cultural and research center in Cusco. For her, things in Peru are delayed or running late most of the time. She was stunned by how often conferences, even at the national level, would start sometimes two or three hours late. Even at her wedding in Cusco, the registrar was half an hour late. However, when working in remote areas, one needs to be more understanding. “Sometimes it took representatives from villages two days to reach the city,” Towl recalled. “If a bus breaks down, you have no choice but to wait for the next one.” At times, that means people would not show up at all. Additionally, although most people in the city have a cellphone, in rural areas access to a phone is much more limited. This may seem like a no-brainer, but you will need Spanish skills. Most development work takes place in rural areas, where virtually none of the locals speak English or any European language other than Spanish. Actually, many people in rural areas only speak Quechua, Aymara, or another indigenous language. But Spanish should do. It is definitely better to arrive with a job in hand, as finding one in Peru may be a hard process. Some expats with teaching experience can find jobs at international schools and language institutes, but if you want to work with one of the large international NGOs, be aware that those jobs are highly competitive and that you may need to apply for them before arriving. According to Towl, NGOs like Oxfam and the Nature Conservancy employ expats only at the volunteer, internship and managerial levels. Entry- and mid-level positions are usually reserved for Peruvians. Where the job opportunities are There are a wealth of internship and volunteer opportunities, and you will need extensive experience and solid academic credentials in order to obtain a managerial position. While permanent jobs at large international NGOs may be difficult to obtain, there are a number of other options. The country is experiencing an economic boom, mainly driven by mineral, oil and natural gas extraction. This means that the central and local governments have huge budgets for infrastructure projects. Large multinational companies are also investing in major developments, such as pipelines and roads. Both the government and the private sector need consultants to help secure and implement such projects. “There is a lot of infrastructure, construction, and future project planning going on right now,” said Wayne Damphier, an independent consultant from Calgary, Canada. “So, there is a fair bit of opportunities on the professional services side.” Damphier said coming down to Peru would be a great first step, and you can combine business and leisure in one trip. “Peru is one of the most spectacular countries to visit for the simple reason that is has dramatically different geographic regions,” he said. He recommends devoting at least one month to that first trip and doing your homework beforehand. You should be familiar with the most important NGOs and agencies working in your field of expertise and make appointments ahead of time, so that you can start networking right away. According to Damphier, now a Peruvian resident, engineering and technical environmental consulting are hot topics, although competition from local professionals is on the rise. After securing your first project, however, you will have the necessary experience and credentials to get the next one much more easily. Visa issues Citizens from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union do not need to apply for a visa before arriving in Peru. Tourist visas for up to three months are issued at the Lima airport or other entry points. Once you are offered a job in Peru, you will need to exit the country and re-enter with either a business visa (which you can virtually purchase at a Peruvian consulate outside of Peru and will let you sign contracts) or a work visa. You will probably need to contact a lawyer while in the country for a work visa, as well as for a residency visa, if you plan to stay for several years.

29211,"A turn to the slums; a call for alms “The weak ‘n’ the strong ‘n’ the rich ‘n’ the poorGather together ain’t room for no more.Crowdin’ up above and crowded down belowWhen someone disappears you never even know.”- Bob Dylan When the people’s prophet penned those lyrics in 1962, he probably had no idea just how accurate they would be 45 years later. It might be a displaced Darfuri bunking with his cousin in Khartoum, a baby born in Rio de Janeiro, or an immigrant renting an apartment in Mumbai. But someday in the coming months, such everyday occurrences will mark the reorientation of humanity from a predominantly rural to a mostly urban species. And that’s just the beginning. The latest United Nations report on global population predicts nearly 5 billion urbanites by 2030, up from 3.3 billion, with the majority of the increase occurring among poor people in the developing world. Many are unlikely to receive adequate aid. Assuming that city dwellers have a leg up, donor agencies and humanitarian organizations have long trained poverty alleviation efforts on rural areas. “Most agencies have a rural bias,” acknowledged U.N.-Habitat’s Rasna Warah, author of the most recent State of the World’s Cities report, in a recent interview. “It’s assumed that citizens of cities will take care of themselves, that cities are islands of prosperity and therefore you don’t need to bother with city residents.” There is some truth to this. Because of greater infrastructure funding, the integration of women into the workforce and greater foreign investment, urban per capita incomes are often considerably higher than rural areas in the developing world, according to U.N.-Habitat and a recent report from the International Institute for Environment and Development. The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. Estimates put today’s global slum dwellers at about 1 billion, with the United Nations predicting an additional 400 million by 2020. And inhabitants of these growing pockets of urban poverty face the greatest risk of water scarcity, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. “Living in an overcrowded and unsanitary slum,” concludes Warah’s report, “is more life-threatening than living in a poor rural village.” These areas are “neglected by local authorities and the development agencies,” Warah added. “It’s a total blind spot.” Further, the U.N. Population Fund argues that shelter is at “the core of urban poverty.” Thus, we turn to that most desperate of urban dwellings, the slum, as it yearns for a turn in the aid and development spotlight. Power to the people: Three cases In the early 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slums is people power. Groups of informal settlement communities have been banding together – within cities, countries and internationally – to create federations able to wield social and political clout. Popping up in more than 20 countries and improving housing for millions over the past several years, these movements have quietly become the most potent and promising innovation for global slum improvement and eradication. “The urban poor had been, at best, passive recipients and, at worst, completely absent from the planning and implementing of slum upgrading projects,” Warah said. Planners have begun to realize that urban poor are “in the best position to advocate for their rights vis-à-vis local governments, and design and implement slum-upgrading schemes,” she added Recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia, and Mumbai, India, underscore this new direction, which, although promising, is no panacea. Two steps forward in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia’s first democratic election in 1993 and increasingly after the economic crisis and greater political stability post-1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh has risen sharply but also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 study found that more than 20 percent of the city’s population – 172,000 people – lived in informal settlements, about two-thirds of whom were without toilets, water or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government formed the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for relocation and housing needs. But the urban improvement ball didn’t really start rolling until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001. A joint program between the local government, international nongovernmental organizations (U.N.-Habitat and the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights) and the community (the Solidarity for Urban Poor Federation, local chiefs and the Urban Resource Center), the strategy employed an innovative approach from the outset, initiating a study from local communities and independent consultants before taking any decisions. Findings revealed that previous relocation efforts had failed because plans had not been taken with the people’s participation, the resettlement locations had not been wisely chosen, and expenses had not been adequately considered. Ultimately, the report recommended relocation in only the rarest cases, instead advocating upgrading and redevelopment of existing slums and settlements. Studies of land availability, eviction practices and development possibilities followed, and when they were completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and inclusive workshops. Thus, the precedent had been set: This would be an initiative that would build relationships between different levels of society and administration, share knowledge, and employ cooperative methods to improve the living conditions of the poor. By early 2003, several successful pilot projects had been implemented. When UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event that May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy to provide secure land tenure and assist in upgrading 100 informal settlement communities each year until all the city’s poor communities had land tenure and full basic services. Observers from both sides applauded the progress. “This reflects a changing attitude,” Municipal Cabinet Chief Mann Chhoeurnn said at the event. “The position of poor people as important actors in solving the city’s housing problems is being increasingly accepted by various levels of the government.” “In this process in Phnom Penh, poor people are the agents of change, they are the ones influencing the government and persuading it to support what people want,” Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, told reporters at the time. “Today’s announcement by the prime minister represents a totally new direction. There is a critical mass of the urban poor in place now in Phnom Penh.” In the interim, there have been successes – such as a recent land-sharing settlement at a settlement called Borie Kiela – as well as failures. In mid-2006, the Human Rights Watch reported the evictions of at least 6,000 Phnom Penh shack dwellers. And the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their homes when government forces demolished their living structures. Media and monitoring groups were barred from the site, and the evicted were given 4-by-10-meter plots at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood-prone village on the outskirts of the city without running water, electricity, schools, health care or waste management systems. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A crowded, chaotic city in which terrible poverty abuts grand decadence, Mumbai may well be the perfect microcosm of the demands and the risks, the wonders and complexities of 21st century urban living. With about 8 million of 18 million residents living in informal settlements or on city streets, and several major redevelopment plans reaching into the billions of U.S. dollars, it is also a fine testing ground for contemporary resettlement techniques. (Note that in India, the states, not the national government, control housing and other infrastructure issues.) First up is the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $945 million plan initiated in 2002 to upgrade and assist the densely populated city’s aging and decrepit transportation facilities. Backed by a $542 million loan from the World Bank, the project includes the relocation of 20,000 shacks and shanties along roads and railways and is scheduled for completion in 2008. All had gone as planned until an early 2006 World Bank analysis found that resettlement efforts fell below previously established World Bank resettlement standards. As a result, the bank suspended its financing that March. Only after state government officials altered the plans several months later, agreeing to resettle people inside the city, did the bank renew payments. Next is the plight of the pavement dwellers. Across the city of Mumbai, tens of thousands of urban poor have lived on streets and sidewalks for decades, in fragile, temporary dwellings without basic services. In April 2006, these so-called pavement dwellers won a hard-fought housing battle when hundreds were given keys to their own homes. Two local grass-roots NGOs (the National Slum-Dwellers’ Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers) and a women’s collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years, and achieved success in late 2004, when the state agreed to house all of the city’s nearly 100,000 pavement dwellers on government-purchased land over the next two years. The keys to new homes in suburban Mankhurd were that policy’s first fruit. The most divisive effort has to do with developing Dharavi, Mumbai’s monster shantytown and home to a million residents, according to some estimates. Living conditions have improved in recent years: Residents have 24-hour electricity and running water for one hour every day; about 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial purposes like banks and restaurants; and most inhabitants have a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas stove. But a controversial $2.5 billion Dharavi Redevelopment Plan looms. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in association with the state, the plan lays out plans for new hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in The Wall Street Journal’s India publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi project could bring nearly $2.6 billion into state government coffers because of rising real estate prices in Mumbai. Some 25 financiers and contractors from around the world have begun bidding for the prized waterfront parcel even as resettlement plans provide for an estimated half of Dharavi residents. Jokin Arputham, president of the National Slum Dwellers’ Association, is among those battling the project. “In Dharavi, it is a real estate scam,” Arputham, who has helped push through equitable projects in South Africa and Malawi as well as in India, told Frontline Magazine this past June. “It is pulling the same trick on the airport slums.” Arputham referred to a fourth ongoing plan, to redevelop and expand the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have lived in ramshackle dwellings for more than 40 years. With India booming and Mumbai real estate becoming more valuable by the day, their 276 acres represent prime land. Residents were given notices of eviction last February, but with no resettlement site or any rehabilitation package, they are unlikely to budge soon. “The problem is that the government has yet to identify the land and that is a huge task given the lack of land availability in Mumbai,” said a spokesman of the Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium slated to develop the parcel. In October 2007, the relocation effort was awarded to a private developer, which expected the process of relocating some 85,000 households to as yet unidentified land to take up to four years. Back at Dharavi, the government recently halted the bidding process and backed off its ambitious redevelopment plan, likely in response to residents’ furor. In November, International Institute for Environment and Development Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring ways to develop Dharavi in cooperation with residents’ organizations as well as developers and NGOs. “Hopefully, a good compromise between the inhabitants’ needs and the needed improvement in conditions in Dharavi will be arrived at,” Satterthwiate said. And after the short-lived funding hiccup of mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has shown considerable progress as well. As of August 2007, nearly 17,000 households have been relocated into their own proper homes with running water, indoor toilets and electricity. Real incomes have increased for many along with personal security, according to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited one of the new resettlement sites and pronounced himself pleased. “It is a fine accomplishment to have been able to move ahead with critical transport infrastructure in a way that takes care of people who have very little,” he told reporters. Thailand cares about secure housing In 2000, Thailand’s mostly ineffective Urban Community Development Office merged with another agency to form the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding and networking arm for poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlements still lacked organization and scale, and 5,500 low-income communities housing 8.25 million inhabitants in 300 cities remained. Then, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“secure housing”) and Baan Us Arthorn (“we care”). The first provided subsidies and loans to help poor communities improve their housing environments, while the second constructed and sold subsidized flats and houses for lower-income households. From the beginning, Thailand’s national slum initiative was grandly ambitious. In a 2005 review of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the plan reconceived “how to achieve large-scale impacts by supporting local community-driven processes in each urban center, which, when added together, achieve city and national scale.” Now in its fourth year, upgrading efforts are either finished or under way in 949 poor communities in 226 cities and involving some 53,000 households, according to CODI. A closer look The variety of slum upgrading and resettlement efforts are legions, as are the degrees of their success. That is why experts from the World Bank, U.N.-Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development have in recent years arrived at a general consensus about what’s required for effective slum improvement or resettlement: broad-based and sustained urban planning initiatives that respect and incorporate the views of the local poor; public-private sector partnerships; improvements that include, at a minimum, land tenure and basic services; and, if possible, dispassionate international assistance. That last point is exemplified by the World Bank’s conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donor money conditional on equitable implementation could go a long way toward more effective projects. But despite the progress, inequitable policies are not uncommon. South African government efforts to evict thousands of residents from a township just outside Cape Town in September 2006 were met with violent resistance. And just over a year later, some 20,000 residents still faced eviction as a result of a multimillion-dollar government-backed housing project. The Cape Town scheme is not dissimilar to ongoing efforts in Durban and World Bank-supported evictions in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government, too, vowed to eliminate all squatter communities in three years’ time, threatening forcible removal for any that didn’t comply. “I hope these evictions will slow, but the power of the vested interests within government and land owners is difficult to control,” said Satterthwaite, pointing to Slum Dwellers International and local federations of the poor as key to stopping forcible removals. The ups and downs of the Phnom Penh and Mumbai efforts also underscore the need to remain vigilant and pragmatic. “Social and political forces supported by better information and improved communication,” said the State of World Population 2007, “will have to come into play to denounce deceitful and ruthless maneuvers that can stand in the way of improvement in the lives of the poor.” Long a motivating factor in the creation of cities, greed will continue to play a part in urban development, making the abusive practices of developers and officials a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represent about half of the original five-year goals, still a significant accomplishment. Boonyabancha highlighted the project’s breadth. “Working on a city-wide scale suddenly makes apparent the differences between all the slums within the same constituency,” she wrote in her study for the journal Environment and Urbanization. “If the process is managed properly, suddenly all of these differences become a kind of university, where people learn about their own city.” More importantly, the Thai initiatives were designed and approved by the poor themselves, with government subsidies and loans given directly to poor communities that then plan and implement housing and services improvements of their choosing. Many see this empowerment as integral to the plan’s success; Boonyabancha has called it “a new politics of slum upgrading.” “This direction is only possible because people have done the groundwork first,” she added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor doing their part, two prominent urban development experts put the onus on local and national governments. “Underneath almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction are issues of governance,” Warah said in U.N. News Center repor. She pointed to health care, education and basic services, and advocated stronger and more integrated governmental intervention. Satterthwaite saw encouraging signs. “City and municipal governments are the key,” he said. “But national reforms that strengthen local government capacity and accountability to their citizens helps, and some national governments have moved a long way to improving this.” Satterthwaite pointed to government-slum dweller partnerships in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most projects had been created from the bottom up by communities of urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, donors and NGOs could reorient their efforts to foster and nurture cooperative projects between governments and urban poor communities. “The only international agencies likely to have influence on national and city governments are those with serious funding that these governments want or need – and this means relatively few such agencies,” said Satterthwaite. “The real problem is that the large official aid agencies and development banks are not very good at working direct with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to supporting the needed increase in competence and capacity among city and municipal governments; many official aid agencies have no urban policy at all, and most have structures ill equipped to support the kinds of pro-poor urban reforms that are needed.” NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid have committed to building and improving low-income urban shelters. Most find the work difficult but rewarding. “It is more difficult to integrate things in urban areas because it is an impenetrable environment,” Helena Gayle, director of CARE International, which has been working in Nairobi’s Kibera slum, said in a recent interview. “Urban areas are dense; they are complicated. It is not so much that the actual substance of the programs will change—for instance we do village savings and loans but in urban settings they are called group savings and loans—but you just have a lot more complex networks to work with.” Gayle also saw another problem. “We are somewhat driven by who is actually providing resources for work in this area, and we feel like there aren’t enough donors who recognize the need to look at urban poverty as a high priority,” she said. This is not news. In a 2003 journal article, M. Vitor Serra, lead World Bank urban specialist, urged greater donor involvement in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended the following: learning from and incorporating the perspectives of the poor; scaling projects at the national level while devolving responsibility to local governments; and fostering private partnerships. About a century ago, Jacob Riis, the muckraking journalist and champion of the poor, wrote that “the slum is the measure of civilization.” One wonders when we will learn.

Maximiliano Cox heads the Food And Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Rural Development Division, the body that works to ensure that policies, programs, projects and institutions in developing countries assisted by FAO are geared towards enhancing rural livelihoods in an ecological, social and economically sustainable manner. The Rural Development Division is one of 3 Divisions of FAO's Sustainable Development Department. It works primarily with farmer organizations, and public institutions in developing countries to promote food security, enhance rural people's livelihoods and ensure equitable access to natural resources, principally land. This is done through assisting policy formulation, program and project implementation and capacity building for the main actors in the rural scene. Maximiliano explained, ""The Division's purpose is to propose policies, programs, projects and institutional changes, that support the enhancement of the livelihoods of the poor in rural areas, and to better integrate policies relating to agriculture and access to land."" As Director, Maximiliano overseas the two main areas of the Division's work: the Land Tenure Service and the Rural Institutions and Participation Service. Maximiliano told us,""My role is to try to get the best out of the different professionals that work in the Division."" The Land Tenure Service deals with policies that allow rural poor to equitably improve their access to land. Land titling, land reform, and improvements in traditional land access systems all fall under its remit. The Rural Institutions and Participation Service is involved in assisting member governments in restructuring and strengthening the private and pubic institutions that help the rural poor and establishing ways and means to increase the participation of the rural poor in the decisions that will improve their livelihoods so as to make them become the main actors in their own development. Even considering the importance of agriculture on social, economic and political conditions for rural populations in most countries, the work of the Division is not restricted only with the agricultural sector, but also involves other non-agricultural activities that rural poor engage in, as such it has an influence beyond that of mere food output. ""I see the major challenge in my position as finding ways and means to strengthen the capacity of rural actors to improve substantially their livelihoods. The improvement in rural livelihoods is the most effective way of protection against the ill effects of globalization."" Maximiliano affirmed, ""Globalization has many advantages, but it they aren't properly channeled it will fortify the social and economic inequalities that are widespread in developing countries. Rural people will be the ones left behind. Our work is about making democracy work in economic and social terms."" Maximiliano studied and undergraduate degree in Agronomy with a specialization in agricultural economics at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile before moving to the University of California in Berkley to gain his Masters in Agricultural Economics and to undertake doctoral studies in economics at the London School of Economics. Maximiliano has had a varied national and international career. He was Professor and Director of the Agriculture Economics Department of his Alma Mater in Santiago, Chile, Vice Minister of Agriculture in Chile during the first democratic government after the dictatorship period, worked with the World Bank and had extensive consultancy work for the Inter-American Development Bank and FAO. Though retiring from the FAO in 2004, Maximiliano is keen to leave a positive imprint on the Rural Development Division's work. ""I would like to leave here having identified the best ways to help countries implement policies and institutional changes that will help improve the living conditions of the rural poor and help them become more empowered in fostering their own development."" He affirmed. Beyond work at the FAO, Maximiliano has no plans to take things easy. He told us, ""I have some ideas and I think some writing would be interesting. Maybe returning to university teaching. I left university a long time ago and I now would like to be able to go back there and bring some of my experience of international field work in agriculture and rural development to bring more practicality to university students.""",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Maximiliano Cox heads the Food And Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Rural Development Division, the body that works to ensure that policies, programs, projects and institutions in developing countries assisted by FAO are geared towards enhancing rural livelihoods in an ecological, social and economically sustainable manner.

Numerous global organizations are now pushing for the use of environment-friendly power sources. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) established the Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Initiative to promote renewable power sources, energy efficiency, and carbon financing among Latin America and Caribbean nations. Juan Roberto Paredes heads the renewable energy and energy efficiency component of this IDB initiative. “Some of the current [renewable energy] technologies, like wind, are typical win-win situations, you diversify the energy matrix, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, [prevent pollution], produce jobs and in some cases even reduce current electricity prices,” said Paredes, who recently spearheaded a project that provided US$ 120 million in IDB assistance to a Brazilian wind rotor blades manufacturer. As the bank’s clean energy specialist specializing on wind, Paredes – who joined the IDB almost half a year ago – is tasked to offer technical advice on the agency’s renewable energy investments. “This includes support to private sector investments and loan operations as well,” Paredes said. “The main support to the member countries is directed to increase capacity building and better regulatory frameworks for the successful implementation of renewable energies,” Paredes added, citing that the Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Initiative “tries to fill the gap between technical and financial feasibility for small developers who have to face difficult access to finance institutions.” Paredes is also involved in IDB’s programs to create centers of excellence on renewable energy technologies and identify marine resources in the region. “[Renewable energy] technologies are still unknown in many countries and their technical maturity and climate friendly advantages are not considered as an alternative to high oil prices and dependency on fossil fuels,” he said. As such, the best consolation for this power specialist is the increase in public utilization of sustainable energy options. “Coal and nuclear are again on the table while [renewable energy] solutions [are] in our hands,” he underscored. In the future, Paredes hopes to boost the public awareness on climate friendly technologies among Latin American nations. Before joining the bank, Paredes worked for leading European consultancy firms on wind energy, spearheading the installation of a 200MW+ wind farm in North Spain and conducting studies on photovoltaic water pumping and CFD wind resource modeling in complex terrain among others. Switching careers from private to public sphere, Paredes remarked that “the number of barriers increase since access to finance in the public sector is limited.” He added that “bureaucracy and sometimes risk adversity make the work difficult.” Paredes, a German citizen, attended undergraduate studies in physics and mechanical engineering at the Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.

62078,"MCC Expands Monitoring & Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation allows donor agencies to measure the success of projects or know why they failed. For the Millennium Challenge Corp., this twin process is not one to be taken lightly. As senior director for monitoring, evaluation and economics, Shiranthi ""Shiro"" Gnanaselvam oversees the agency's rigid M&E plan. Her team works closely with in-country M&E groups from planning to implementation. Gnanaselvam has more than 14 years of experience in development, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. She previously served as public sector management specialist at the World Bank and as a private-sector management consultant. Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex on possible changes to MCC's monitoring and evaluation strategies as well as the distinct features of the agency's M&E policy. Can you give us some examples for changes to MCC monitoring and evaluation strategies that are currently under consideration? One of the things we're in the process of wrapping up, and we've been working on it for the last year, is to develop common indicators in some of the key sectors where we have significant investments. So if you go to our Web site, you will see that we have indicators for agriculture, roads, irrigation and land. And we've been adding some additional sectors. We're very country-focused, so the M&E model is also very focused on that country's particular compact and tracking the results towards the goal of that country's compact. However, as a federal agency, we are also called upon sometimes to report progress by sector, particularly in areas where we have a lot of investments. For instance, 26 percent of our investment is in transport. Now roads isn't all of transport, but it's a big chunk of investments in transportation. And so, therefore, for these sectors where we have significant investments, we have come up with common indicators that are then kind of incorporated into each country's monitoring and evaluation plan, and they report on them repeatedly. Can you explain this further? So, one of the things that we track in every program where there is a kind of a farmer training commercialization component is the number of farmers that have been trained. If there is a business development component, then we track the number of enterprises that have been trained. So those are the common indicators that we make sure are in every single M&E plan, so that we can add the number [of] farmers who were trained in Honduras with the number of farmers trained in Ghana, with the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. So that's a common indicator initiative. And it's something that we had to go back and do because we still kind of singularly focused on country-focused [programs] that we didn't think about the commonality aspect; so now we're including that as well in our M&E framework. Another example of something that we're working on right now is to flush out the set of evaluations and assessments that will be developed when a compact closes out. So we're getting close, as our earliest compacts are preparing to close out, and we're starting to define very clearly what evaluations and assessments will be conducted at the close out of a compact. But in addition to that, there might be other assessments that we want to the MCA [Millennium Challenge Account] or the MCC or others to do for us from an independent assessment. So we're still working out the details of that. Do you expect MCC priorities and evaluation strategies to change significantly under the new leadership? My feeling is that our approach - that there won't be any significant fundamental change to our M&E. Might there be changes on the margins? Possibly. You know, our early compacts are now, in a year or so, going to [be] drawing [to a] close. So now we're thinking about, how are we going to close them out? How are we going to document them from a process point of view, from a quality of entry point of view, from a sustainability point of view? How do we document it? How do we share it? All of those things. So I think as our agency matures, certainly there will be enhancements, modifications, changes to our model. But the core pillars of it will remain the same. What do you think you've learned so far as an agency? Ken Hackett, a member of the MCC board of directors, said at the Sept. 8 briefing held at the agency's headquarters that MCC is a learning organization. So what is something that has been learned so far at least on the evaluation side? I'm sure there is interim monitoring going on to get a sense of what you're learning so far. That's true. We - certainly through our monitoring system - we are able to track progress. But we always like to wait for the impact evaluation… I will give you an example of an impact evaluation that was completed. It was not for a compact project; it was for a threshold project in Burkina Faso. And I think that was also referenced at the [Sept. 8] outreach event. That had some interesting findings; it was a pretty rigorous methodology so the findings were very robust. It showed the package of intervention that were supported in this threshold activity really worked and really did achieve the outcome it had intended to achieve and in fact exceeded them. Now that program has been kind of expanded and is now [undertaking a] compact that we now have with Burkina Faso. It is interesting to see that your M&E policy allows in-country M&E teams to modify targets, indicators and baselines within the same compact, but they can't write a new compact. Can you tell me more about this? Yes, it is allowed to make changes to an M&E plan, and there are often very legitimate reasons for making changes. For example, when a change might be made because when the first M&E plan was put in place, there was survey data that formed the baseline that was 5 years old. But in the year leading up to [a program], we may have paid for a new survey to establish a new baseline. That's a very legitimate reason for making a modification to a baseline. At the time of the first M&E, we might not have known - we might have known what the end of compact target was that we were aiming for based on the economic analysis we had done for the project but because the implementer was not yet contracted yet for us. We may not have known what the interim year target are for a given activity … or there may have been targets which [were] based on hiring the contractor who was going to implement the work and their work plan. We realized that we had to change the sort the pattern of those targets. Then there are other situations where compacts have to be restructured because their current fluctuations and whatever it is, and you thought that you could construct, I don't know, 1,000 kilometers of road with the funds allotted for the roads project. But when the bids come in, you realize that you can only construct 700 kilometers. That is a restructuring. So [that's] what we've tried to do. So while, yes, you can make changes, we have very clearly spelled out in our M&E policy for what reason you can make a change, under what circumstances does MCC need to approve, and how high do we rachet up the approval. For instance, if there is an end-of-compact target change and we re-run the economic analysis and find that the investment is no longer justifiable by the end of compact target change, that then requires a racheting-up of the approved change. And those changes really only take place where [there] is a significant restructuring. So those end of target changes would have to take place [or be approved] at very high places in MCC. Have you ever encountered a situation where changes were made to the compact by MCA without gaining the approval of MCC? The post-section [includes] our new M&E indicators and targets. This is something we only recently added to our M&E policy. What we might have seen [is] a difference in format and how the changes were documented, and lack of clarity of the approval process. And we wanted to make that really very clear and transparent. So we saw the need. We wrote a new policy, and now we're implementing it. So MCAs understand under what circumstances changes can be made, what is allowed, what standards they need to meet, how the changes are approved as well as documented. What strategies have you developed in order to ensure a certain amount of MCC oversight while allowing your partner countries to ""own"" MCC-funded development initiatives? On the M&E side, a big factor is getting that balance right… There are two main factors: one is the complexity of the program; the second can be trying to find people with monitoring and evaluation skills. Monitoring and evaluation isn't a typically kind of available skill set - it's an unusual skill set. In some countries, it's harder to find. In other countries, there are actually very skilled people working in those areas. We're able see impact a lot more on the M&E side if there is high capacity for M&E in the MCA. We're able to step back less if there's less capacity.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex on possible changes to MCC's monitoring and evaluation strategies as well as the distinct features of the agency's M&E policy.

64874,"How Multinationals Can Leverage the Role of the IFC for Development By Ibrahim Ismayilov, Samir Taghiyev, Olga Godunova, and Farzin Mirmotahari In 1994 the multinational energy company BP, together with a group of other oil companies, signed a production sharing agreement with the government of Azerbaijan to develop the country’s oil and gas wealth. This agreement was officially called the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil development and Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline projects, but was widely referred to as the “Contract of the Century.” It offered Azerbaijan, an independent country following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the opportunity to use its natural resources to improve the lives of its people and ameliorate widespread poverty. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) was one of the leading financiers of this project. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Azerbaijan had endured the collapse of the Soviet Union, economic disintegration, and a devastating war with neighboring Armenia. The scale of economic collapse was severe even by Soviet standards: In 1995 GDP was only 42 percent of its 1990 pre-independence level. Unemployment was endemic: out of a total population of 8 million, about one million Azerbaijanis were refugees and internally displaced persons who had fled the areas occupied by Armenian forces and another 2 million Azerbaijanis had left the country, mainly for Russia to find work. All this could change with the “Contract of the Century.” It could not only provide massive oil revenues for the Azerbaijani government, but also offer an opportunity for a large part of the Azerbaijani private sector to rebuild itself by working with BP and other major oil and gas service companies. But to do this Azerbaijani companies would have to compete with international firms for contracts which demanded international quality levels. For most local companies, this seemed an almost insurmountable obstacle. The Enterprise Centre To address this crucial issue, in 2002 BP launched the Baku Enterprise Centre (EC) as a one-stop shop where local suppliers could obtain information, training and other forms of technical assistance, in order to bid for and win supply contracts with BP and other large companies in Azerbaijan. IFC, as the lead financier of the ACG-BTC Project hired a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Linkages Co-ordinator who was based in the EC in order to co-ordinate BP and IFC support for SMEs. Various types of training and mentoring services in technology, tenders and bidding, basic business disciplines and other fields were launched and continue to be provided at the EC. The Centre also built a comprehensive supplier database to help link local firms with foreign companies in need of a vendor. To this day an electronic job board lets companies know in a timely, efficient way about potential opportunities. In addition, the EC sponsors a variety of fee-based courses to enhance general economic opportunities for entrepreneurs, and to improve the chances that small local businesses will win contracts on which they bid. The EC also encourages international contractors to invest in training and infrastructure and to source materials and services locally, and provides a forum/collaboration facility for various NGOs, international financial institutions and development agencies that contribute to business development in Azerbaijan. In another joint project between IFC and BP, the Azerbaijan Bank Training Center (ABTC) was contracted to deliver small business courses in local languages using a fee-based system. The goal was to build up the local small business services sector, create a market for such services, and improve the skills of the local consultants providing them. Post-project, ABTC continues to provide training and consulting services to local companies in Azerbaijan in a commercially sustainable way. In June 2007, BP and its co-venturers in the oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan also launched the Enterprise Development and Training Program (EDTP) – a new three-year multi-million initiative in support of local business development. The program is part of BP’s efforts to continue to increase the local content share of their total contracts in Azerbaijan, and is financed through the oil and gas co-venturers Regional Development Initiative and coordinated by the Enterprise Center. The need for access to finance Despite the success of BP’s local enterprise development efforts, it became apparent early on that the technical and business support and training were insufficient by themselves. Without access to affordable finance, local enterprises would find it very difficult to compete with international companies for the contracts offered by the BP’s oil and gas projects. Most local SME suppliers required new technology and equipment to achieve the quality of service required by BP. Financing from local banks was not available, as they required collateral equal to 100 percent – 150 percent of the loan amount and the terms were inflexible. BP and IFC began to consider a proposal to develop the financing to improve access to finance for local SME suppliers. Out of these discussions came the concept of the Supplier Finance Facility (SFF) pilot project, to be developed jointly by IFC and BP, and implemented through a local bank in Azerbaijan. The parties agreed to start a pilot project with the objective to test the viability of supplier finance, to gain experience and identify key lessons. In June 2006, IFC and BP launched a $316,000 pilot Supplier Finance Facility (SFF) involving the Microfinance Bank of Azerbaijan, providing mediumterm funding for working capital and capital expenditures to small and medium oil services suppliers to BP and its partners in Azerbaijan. Suppliers were able to use their contracts with BP as collateral, thereby reducing the need for using fixed assets and cash (which in many cases were not available). In late 2006, the pilot was expanded to a $15 million investment project involving the three parties. So far, applications from eight suppliers in a number of industry sectors have been evaluated–from transportation services to printing, engineering and waste management. Two applications have been approved and a substantial increase in credit applications and disbursements is expected in 2008, according to IFC estimates. Positive results to date In 2007, BP and its co-venturers spent approximately $111 million on procurement from local SMEs, increasing dramatically from a baseline of $13 million in 2002. During 2006 the company worked with 393 SMEs. From 2003-2006, 1606 new business contracts, worth $249 million, were awarded to local SMEs. During this same period, 562 SMEs received training on the contract tendering process, quality control, and health, safety and environment (HSE) standards. Case study: Debet An example of a local company which benefited from the EC and SFF was Debet. Founded in 1997, the company manufactures and supplies quality safety gloves, helmets, work wear, corporate clothing and promotional wear for BP and numerous other companies in Azerbaijan. Currently Debet Uniform employs 117 people. The development of Debet Uniform was possible through the supplier development project launched in 2004 and implemented in partnership with German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the Enterprise Centre, and IFC. GTZ was contracted specifically to provide an experienced specialist – a mentor – that could provide the technical and business training and advisory services that were needed. A gap analysis of Debet was conducted which showed where the key areas that needed improvement were. Since 2006 this project has been funded by BP’s Regional Development Initiative (RDI), a long term socio-economic development program funded by BP and its co-venturers in major oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan. In 2007, BP awarded a $6 million, 3-year contract to Debet Uniform Ltd for the supply of personal protective equipment in Azerbaijan and Georgia. A key condition for Debet to be able to fulfil this contract was to obtain medium/long-term financing. Debet Uniform received a loan from the Suppliers Finance Facility, using its contract with BP as collateral, and with a term of 3 years, equal to the term of the BP supply contract. Debet’s work, which was previously performed by a foreign firm, was an example and signal to the market place that with proper support and assistance, local companies could compete and win in the international market place! Due to rapidly increasing oil exports and the high oil price, Azerbaijan’s economy grew at an amazing rate of 34 percent in 2007. BP and IFC’s assistance will help ensure than small businesses can also participate, develop and benefit from this growth.

76017,"Candid images, useful information: The UN’s social media plan Ban Ki-moon donned his usual smile as he sat across ABC News’s Juju Chang in a studio at United Nations headquarters in New York. Yet this was no usual TV interview. It was a first for the secretary-general: a global conversation on pressing U.N. issues via social media. The Sept. 13 event was streamed live on Facebook, Livestream, Tumblr and the U.N. Webcast. Questions, which numbered more than 5,500, were submitted via Twitter and Weibo. They were sent in U.N. official languages – Arabic, Chinese English, French, Russian and Spanish – as well as in Portuguese and Swahili. According to Nancy Groves, the U.N. social media focal point, that global conversation with Ban is, thus far, the most popular social media event of the United Nations. The U.N. is among the most popular multilateral organizations on Twitter. As of Sept. 23, it had more than half a million Twitter followers. It also has a broad social media presence. Aside from the networks used for Ban’s global conversation, the U.N. is also on Flickr, Storify and YouTube. In this exclusive interview, Groves, who works in the U.N. Department of Public Information’s strategic communications division, shares how social media allows the multilateral organization to minimize resources while carrying out global campaigns. She argues that an organization should have a dedicated, full-time staff to manage its social media efforts. In less than 140 characters, describe your social media strategy or vision. Demystify how the U.N. works – point followers to where the latest information is online – let citizens know how they can participate What has your social media presence allowed you to do that you may not have been able to achieve otherwise? Using social media, we’re able to quickly start mini-campaigns with very few resources apart from staff time and talent. For example, we just launched a new campaign “Let’s Fight Racism!” which shows how each and every one of us plays a role in either contributing to or breaking down racial prejudice and intolerant attitudes. The campaign features postcards that people can send to their friends and family, a video, real-life stories and a quiz. We’ll also have an interactive component on Twitter using the #FightRacism hashtag. Give an example or anecdote for how you’ve used social media in an innovative way. The fact that the U.N. has established presences on social media platforms is in some ways innovative! A few years ago, we were debating whether or not the U.N. could or should even post content online in this way and, to be honest, these debates still take place. Normally we use social media mainly as an information dissemination tool largely because the U.N. has a huge amount of in-demand information to share with people around the world, but we have used it to solicit comments from our fans and followers. For example, around the start of the new year, we asked followers to share their anti-poverty/Millennium Development Goals wishes for 2011, which resulted in 80 Twitter posts from 24 countries around the world. On Facebook, we asked people to send in photos of themselves at U.N. offices. We expected to get a lot of photos from New York, Geneva and Vienna, but were surprised to find people sending in photos from peacekeeping missions and from field offices as well. We received over 100 photos in the span of a few days and that has been one of our most popular Facebook initiative to date. We think this campaign was successful because it put a human face on the U.N. and also emphasized that the U.N. really is more than just peacekeepers, formal meetings and reports. Our most popular event so far was the recent live global conversation with Ban Ki-moon that just took place on Sept. 13. Also popular are behind-the-scenes photos from Ban Ki-moon’s travels around the world. Over the summer, he ended up traveling through South America on a bus because volcano ash disrupted his flight plans and we posted some cell phone photos a colleague took during this trip. People really enjoyed seeing this different, personal side of the secretary-general. This video is another example. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, nonprofit or corporate, need to know about social media and how it can help them? Once basic ground rules are established, such as avoiding posting offensive content, there is no right or wrong way to use social media. Development organizations and NGOs should, however, keep in mind that social media best practices may not be the best practice for every organization. Talking to new social media users, I often hear that they think they don’t have content appropriate to post on social media platforms because they don’t want to sound too serious. If you’re working on a serious subject, a serious post on a social media platform is OK. In fact, your fans and followers want your information and they don’t want their time to be wasted with updates that are not on message. Also, don’t leave social media to an intern or volunteer. Social media is a proven, effective tool – but one that takes time to master – so make sure a staff member is empowered to spend sufficient time on social media efforts and also empowered to make decisions about how to word online content and when/how to post it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Candid images, useful information: The UN’s social media plan Ban Ki-moon donned his usual smile as he sat across ABC News’s Juju Chang in a studio at United Nations headquarters in New York.

76145,"Add value, listen, inspire: Samaritan’s Purse social media plan After crawling out of a mudslide, a girl, along with a group of people, walked on a broken leg searching for help. She made it to a clinic, housed inside a tent, where one of the doctors attended to the injury and provided her with crutches. She was hungry, and so the doctor sent her to the disaster response team from Samaritan’s Purse. The girl was Michelle de Carion, a staff writer for Samaritan’s Purse who blogged about her experience participating in one of the first disaster simulation training exercises of its scale by an international non-governmental organization. It even involved the U.S. Air Force, which tested a state-of-the-art mobile medical unit during the three-day event (Sept. 22-24) at a private estate near the NGO’s headquarters in Boone, N.C., USA. The exercise dealt with an imaginary 8.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico City. The Christian organization, which has been helping victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease and famine since 1970, posted updates of the exercise through Argyle Social and on Twitter. On its Facebook page, many of its more than 360,000 followers applauded the relief group for the undertaking and expressed eagerness to get involved in its work. Devex spoke with Hope Blaylock, integrated marketing manager at Samaritan’s Purse, on day one of the exercise. In this exclusive interview, she shared a few more examples of how the organization has used social media in innovative ways and some helpful, free tools for evaluating social media metrics. She also emphasized that real-life relationships play a vital role in how development organizations should build and engage audiences on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. In fewer than 140 characters, describe your social media strategy or vision. In participation, add value. In conversation, listen. In relationship, inspire. In partnership, provide opportunity. What has your social media presence allowed you to do that you may not have been able to achieve otherwise? Because Samaritan’s Purse is an international disaster relief organization, a lot of the value of social media is in the ability to communicate with our donors in real time, during immediate responses. Very often, we’re on the scene of a disaster within 24-48 hours. … Our teams are there in the middle of devastation that the vast majority of the public has yet to comprehend or really even see. So social media has given us the opportunity to let them see from our unique perspective in that moment, almost immediately, and often to provide information about what’s really happening on the ground that people haven’t seen in the mainstream media yet. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we had teams on the ground very quickly and at first, just had iPhone videos from our vice president of programs saying, “We’re here in this region in Japan, this is what you’re looking at, and this is what we’re going to do today.” The videos were very successful. We posted them every day. Sometimes we get to highlight more celebratory events, like on July 9, when South Sudan became an independent nation. … We had behind-the-scenes videos of the ceremony and exclusive interviews with political figures, but the posts that really received the most interaction and feedback were just cellphone photos of South Sudanese people that were captioned with a quote saying what independence meant to them. Those posts received far more interaction than anything else. … It really highlighted that our audience — and I think people who are interested in the kind of work that relief organizations do — they want to hear from the people we’re helping, and they want to hear those first-hand accounts, and they really feel a personal and emotional connection to the work that we’re doing. They don’t only want to hear numbers and statistics. … Social media has given us a great opportunity to do that and to highlight the real things that are happening every day. How has social media broadened your support base? You know, it’s hard to say. … People who have supported Samaritan’s Purse for a long time now also follow us on social media. But we have been able to reach a much younger generation who support the relief work we do. We have different audiences on our different platforms. On Facebook, a lot of those fans are the people who have followed Samaritan’s Purse and supported our ministry for years. And then on Twitter, a lot of our followers are people who are in the relief world, who are actually in the same places we’re doing our work … and they trust that the information we’re giving them is correct, that we’re giving them an accurate picture of what’s going on. And so these audiences are very different and they want different things, so we give them information differently. … On our Facebook page, a lot of the supporters want to know how are you showing God’s love to people through this work. And on Twitter, it’s people who want to know the details of the work that we’re doing and the technical aspects of relief. To me, that highlights that one of the most important things to remember as you’re engaging your audience on social media is to know who your audience is, and to know what they care about, what they’re talking about, what they want from you, and how you can add value to conversations that they’re already having. … That’s one of the things we ask ourselves often, because as our audience has grown, it’s changed as well. I think it’s really important to constantly look at your metrics, to look at the kinds of posts your audience engages with the most, and evaluate how you can better serve them, how you can give them the kind of content that they are looking for, and the kind of content they are going to engage with that will activate them to share what you’re doing. Speaking of metrics, what tools do you use for that? We use a combination of a lot of different things. There are many free tools out there that are incredibly helpful. Obviously, Google Analytics, because a lot of the content that we post is housed on our website. … We also use Hootsuite; it’s free and it’s a great tool. And we use a marketing dashboard called Argyle Social that has been a really useful tool for us in terms of tracking and reporting. Sometimes it depends on what event we’re covering, what kind of metrics we’re looking for. I think Facebook Insights are incredibly helpful, and that’s a free tool as well. Give an example or anecdote for how you’ve used social media in an innovative way. Today, our programs department is … simulating a large, full-scale international disaster response, with about 250 people. … They’re out on several acres of land, and they’re being thrown different curve balls of what’s happening in this “disaster” as they would in a real disaster. We’re covering it on social media, and the challenge there is how to talk about a fake disaster without sort of creating a “War of the Worlds” kind of thing where people think that our simulation is a real event. So that was our big challenge, but we really feel that it’s an opportunity for us to educate our audience about the how and why we do what we do, while we’re also improving our own organizational capacity to respond effectively in a disaster. So we’re posting a lot of tweets and giving facts about the details involved in a disaster response, such as: What does an information officer do on the incident management team? Or, what is an incident management team? I think when our audience understands the depth of training and attention to detail that goes into how we respond in crisis, it builds trust in our organization, that we are good stewards of donor support, and also that our responders are trained to the highest level. Building trust with our general audience is really important. This coverage is not anything we’ve done before on the simulation side or the social media side. … It’s a unique way to show our supporters and to show the broader public interested in relief work, what goes into this kind of response — that it’s not just go, show up at the disaster site, and see what you can do. It’s very strategic. There’s a lot of education that goes into how we respond to international disasters effectively, so we can help as many people as possible. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, nonprofit or corporate, need to know about social media and how it can help them? One of the ways that I explain it [social media], especially to people who aren’t as familiar with the differences between this somewhat new form of marketing and traditional marketing, is that it’s sort of like a big high school party. Facebook, Twitter and social media are the party, and everybody’s there, but the people who don’t understand the culture kind of hate on it and say it won’t last or it’s not useful. But the party is still happening, whether you want to be there or not, and it’s still where everybody is. Just like you wouldn’t “be cool” at a party just because you’re there, you won’t be significant on social media just because you’re there. You have to know and understand the culture of the people you’re around to be relevant, and so you have to watch and you have to listen to figure out how your particular audience wants to interact with you. If you’re at a party and you’re telling a story, you’re gauging your audience and you’re looking at their facial expressions and their feedback to see if they think you’re funny. Our audience is primarily on Facebook, but that doesn’t mean everyone else’s audience is there. So really understand where your audience already lives: Where is the party that your organization needs to attend? Who else is influencing them? What or who are they listening to? How do they engage? And then constantly evaluate those things. I think that’s the important thing to do as you begin to engage, but it’s also something that you have to do continually because your audience is always changing. Once you know your audience, you can set goals and you can outline what your objective is for engaging in social media, and you can make a plan for that engagement. You can strategize your content and run various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you measure success. What is success to you? And once you know that … all these things play into making more informed decisions about the way you are engaging. I think social media works because as human beings, we want to be connected and we want to be known. It works for development organizations and nonprofits because it allows global connections to be made, even to really remote places, and to people you wouldn’t necessarily reach in your physical daily life. But the digital relationship is still lacking, and so I think we’ll continue to see development organizations and brands using social media as a tool to enhance an individual’s ability to advocate a cause to people he or she actually knows. In other words, the real-life relationships that your followers have are going to play an even more vital role in how your organization engages and builds your audience.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"She was hungry, and so the doctor sent her to the disaster response team from Samaritan’s Purse. The girl was Michelle de Carion, a staff writer for Samaritan’s Purse who blogged about her experience participating in one of the first disaster simulation training exercises of its scale by an international non-governmental organization. The Christian organization, which has been helping victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease and famine since 1970, posted updates of the exercise through Argyle Social and on Twitter. She also emphasized that real-life relationships play a vital role in how development organizations should build and engage audiences on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. In fewer than 140 characters, describe your social media strategy or vision. The videos were very successful. On Facebook, a lot of those fans are the people who have followed Samaritan’s Purse and supported our ministry for years. And on Twitter, it’s people who want to know the details of the work that we’re doing and the technical aspects of relief. I think Facebook Insights are incredibly helpful, and that’s a free tool as well. One of the ways that I explain it [social media], especially to people who aren’t as familiar with the differences between this somewhat new form of marketing and traditional marketing, is that it’s sort of like a big high school party.","In this exclusive interview, she shared a few more examples of how the organization has used social media in innovative ways and some helpful, free tools for evaluating social media metrics. Because Samaritan’s Purse is an international disaster relief organization, a lot of the value of social media is in the ability to communicate with our donors in real time, during immediate responses. But the digital relationship is still lacking, and so I think we’ll continue to see development organizations and brands using social media as a tool to enhance an individual’s ability to advocate a cause to people he or she actually knows. One of the ways that I explain it [social media], especially to people who aren’t as familiar with the differences between this somewhat new form of marketing and traditional marketing, is that it’s sort of like a big high school party. To me, that highlights that one of the most important things to remember as you’re engaging your audience on social media is to know who your audience is, and to know what they care about, what they’re talking about, what they want from you, and how you can add value to conversations that they’re already having. We’re covering it on social media, and the challenge there is how to talk about a fake disaster without sort of creating a “War of the Worlds” kind of thing where people think that our simulation is a real event. Once you know your audience, you can set goals and you can outline what your objective is for engaging in social media, and you can make a plan for that engagement. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, nonprofit or corporate, need to know about social media and how it can help them? It really highlighted that our audience — and I think people who are interested in the kind of work that relief organizations do — they want to hear from the people we’re helping, and they want to hear those first-hand accounts, and they really feel a personal and emotional connection to the work that we’re doing. She also emphasized that real-life relationships play a vital role in how development organizations should build and engage audiences on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms."
78777,"Available soon: Free, easily accessible UK-funded research findings The U.K. Department for International Development has introduced a new policy that aims to make findings from reports and other research materials it funds more accessible to people in the developing world. DfID’s new Open and Enhanced Access Policy essentially requires researchers who receive funding from the agency to make their outputs available online for free. Outputs covered by the policy include reports, journal articles, books and book chapters, audio and video files, images, data sets, websites and computer software. DfID funds research projects to discover new drugs for malaria, better diagnostic test for tuberculosis, drought-resistant corps, vaccines for cattle diseases, and new ways to tackle various diseases, among others. But findings do not always reach scientists, research bodies, charities and humanitarian organizations in the developing world. The policy will be effective Nov. 1 and cover all new research programs and projects funded in full by DfID contracts or grants awarded from that date. Researchers who received DfID funding before Nov. 1 are not covered, but are encouraged to adopt the policy. Research projects commissioned by third party groups using DfID funds are also covered. Projects partly funded by the agency will also be covered but on a case-to-case basis upon consultation with other funders. Most DfID contracts for research projects already give the agency license to use findings and other output produced from the study, while allowing authors to retain intellectual property rights. The new policy supplements this contractual obligation. The launch of this new policy is in line with a U.K. government-wide effort to make publicly funded studies more accessible to the public. It also appears on trend with various development agencies’ push to open up their knowledge base. “Even the most groundbreaking research is of no use to anyone if it sits on a shelf gathering dust,” U.K. Secretary of State for International Development Andrew Mitchell said July 26. “What’s just as important … is ensuring that these findings get into the hands of those in the developing world who stand to gain most from putting them in to practical use.” The new policy, Mitchell, said is an “important step in that process.” Here are some key requirements and guidelines included in the policy: - Research outputs should be uploaded, whenever possible, to Research for Development — an online portal that provides open and free access to DfID-funded projects. - Researchers should consider as first option websites or portals that provide free access, as opposed to the prevalent trend of using pay-to-access websites. - Findings should be uploaded in quick and easy-to-download formats for the benefit of users with limited Internet connection. - Key findings are translated in relevant local languages, especially if research is country- or region-specific. - Use Creative Commons or similar licenses whenever possible or appropriate. A detailed implementation guide as well as Research for Development’s editorial policy are available on the DfID website.

1,59886,"A Boom in Development Research One little-discussed aid and development sector has bloomed in recent years: development research. With a push for accountability and improved data from New York University's Bill Easterly, and innovative research methods from academics such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Esther Duflo, research is one of the fastest growing sectors in development. The book that might become its bible, ""Knowledge to Policy"" by Fred Karden, hits bookstores this week. But what exactly is development research? There are at least three varieties:1. Researching the developing world: Designers of development programs and policies need to better know what's needed to be able to tailor programming. Researchers from both developing and rich countries examine the situation on the ground and report back. One leader is the Canadian government-backed International Development Research Center, which finances developing world researchers to study issues that are crucial to their communities, including environment, technology, innovation and social policy. The organization also builds local research capacity. Another is the Paris-based Agricultural Research Center for Developing Countries, or CIRAD. This remains the smallest slice of the research sector. 2. Impact measurement: This involves evaluating the effectiveness of development programs. Because of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, this is where much of the research is focused, and it's starting to reach a wider audience. One well-known example is Madrid-based Dara's Humanitarian Response Index. Only a few years old, the HRI is already making an impact. The highly regarded Global Development Network is doing good research too, and sponsored the recent Cairo Conference on evaluating development effectiveness. 3. How 1 and 2 can be used to influence policy. This is the newest area of research and probably the fastest expanding. The 2008 report from the Policy Studies Institute provides a good overview. But it's the Overseas Development Institute's Research and Policy in Development arm that is doing some of the best work in the field. One of its studies found that despite clear evidence about what causes HIV/AIDS in Africa, the crisis deepened in many countries because of donors' reluctance to implement the research findings into their programming. A links page on the RAPID site connects to dozens of other research outfits, like Harvard's Center for International Development, the Duke Center for International Development and Institute of Development Studies. Keep in mind that this is only a very cursory survey of the research field. If you're thinking about a career in development research, note that the RAPID team is not a bunch of wizened academics and technocrats but veteran field workers who are putting their experience to good use. Also, IDRC offers a training and awards program for researchers from Canada and the developing world. Or you can always take your own initiative, like veteran aid worker Tori Hogan.

2,61827,"Urban planning: An answer to today’s city demands The need for better urban management is becoming more intense. More than half of the world’s population now live in cities, an effect of the massive urban growth in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Between 2000 and 2005, cities of the developing world grew by 2.68 percent, more than four times the rate of 0.61 percent in wealthier global regions. Urban planners are here to manage such growth and improve cities. They are versatile professionals that offer solutions to the economic, social, environmental and mobility issues faced by the urban world. Rapid urbanization: A challenge for developing countries Cities in the developing world are expanding at a pace never experienced in Europe or the United States. Megalopolises are multiplying. Today, there are around 400 cities that house more than a million people each, and 75 percent of these are located in low- and middle-income countries. This rapid growth is not easy to absorb for cities in the developing world. New residents need proper transport, decent housing, and access to water and sanitation services. Rapid urbanization also produces pollution, traffic congestion, and even crime. It has also led to large-scale spreading of slums on city fringes. This development has captured the attention of the international community. The United Nations Millennium Declaration sought to improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. All the major development banks have created their urban development section and have provided funding to projects to address challenges of rapid urbanization. The role of urban planners Urban planners aim to put order to “chaos” in cities and municipalities. They focus on organizing the use of land and city space. They also differentiate between existing cities and new ones that are expanding. Interventions by urban planners are required in numerous occasions. These include infrastructure projects dealing with access to water, sewage, or transports; efforts addressing issues related to housing, urban mobility, public space organization and urban patrimony; and institutional programs entailing assistance to local authorities concerning public service delivery or space management. “It is a very dynamic field,” according to Catherine Geisen-Kish, a planning specialist who worked as an urban planner for the city of Cartagena in Colombia. She said urban planners may be involved in such activities as initial research, actual project planning, design review, environmental impact assessment, and stakeholder outreach. Urban planning also appears to be a very versatile practice, feeding off from the professional experiences of architects, engineers, geographers, economists and sociologists. “The position of an urban planner is more at the junction of different sectorial approaches,” said Marie Pierre Bourzai, an urban planner at the French Development Agency. “This multidisciplinary approach is greatly appreciated in emerging countries.” But to be successful, urban planners cannot be generalists: They need to specialize in specific issues related to city planning and land use management. “I don’t think there can be urban planners which can only present as urban planners without any specialization,” said Alain Bertaud, who worked for 20 years as a principal urban planner at the World Bank. Urgent missions for urban planners Urban mobility and transport have become prevalent themes in growing cities. Cities of developing countries could suffer an energy crisis but their current forms condemn them to a great dependency toward the use of cars. Such situation prompts a demand for specialized urban planners. “Since the future needs to be prepared now, I strongly believe in this sector,” Bourzai explained. In cities of emerging countries, land development using public-private partnerships could become a trend. Housing construction, which had been neglected to some extent by funders for some time, has also resumed as a major field of action. “In Senegal, Brazil or South Africa, this trend came back,” Bourzai said. The concept of “city productivity” has also emerged. The way cities are organized spatially determines their productivity, and there is a need for planners who understand the economic forces that drive the use of land. Climate change is a major concern for cities that massively consume energy. More and more, planners are asked to find ways for cities to become more sustainable and more respectful of the environment. These issues are not really specific to the developing world, but they appear as urgent concerns for its cities. “It is an error to think that there are some disciplines particular to developing countries like we believed few years ago,” remarked Bertaud, who has advised municipalities in four continents. “Moreover, the mayors of the major cities of the Third World do not appreciate to be treated differently. A big city is a big city.” Different traditions of urban planning Urban planning tools and methods differ by country and region. This is an important element that planners need to take into account. “You need to understand in which tradition you are working,” explained Julio Davila, a consultant in urban development policy and co-director of Msc Development Administration and Planning at the University College of London’s Development Planning Unit. “You need to know about legislation, different parameters on how to plan things, on how to link up with infrastructure - all these things that are specific to a society.” Former Commonwealth countries, for instance, employ principles by London-based Royal Town Planning Institute. In countries such as Malaysia, India, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia, planners are very likely to follow the British town planning principles. This tradition has a very strong physical planning dimension and focuses on segregated land use. In Latin America, the language of architecture is very influential, so the physical and visual aspects are essential for planners. The French approach, meanwhile, is much more politicized and encompasses elements of urban sociology. Francophone Africa and Brazil use this approach. Municipalities also need people who are trained in their own language of urban planning. As such, urban planners must be flexible and open-minded. They need to combine their multidisciplinary knowledge with an ability to adapt to different contexts and systems. “It is necessary to be interested in other cultures and to avoid establishing hierarchies between them,” Bertaud said. “You need to be able to go from one system to another. It is very important in this sector; it allows you not to suffer when you work.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Urban planners are here to manage such growth and improve cities.

3,62285,"Urbanization and US Foreign Aid Even as the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals approaches, most developing countries are still striving to cut poverty and drift into higher income brackets. There is, however, one catch: No nation has ever achieved higher-income status without undergoing urbanization. In commemoration of World Habitat Day, urban development and housing experts teamed up Oct. 7 for a panel discussion on the topic of urbanization and the future of U.S. aid. Anna Tibaijuka, executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Program or U.N.-Habitat, formed part of the powerhouse of panelists. She pointed out that urbanization and migration are irreversible since they are driven by two main forces: people's expectations and economic pressures. ""People move not because they are better off; they move because they expect to be better off,"" Tibaijuka explained. Rapid urbanization and the incidence of urban slums are the results of these two forces. It is estimated that 1.1 billion people in developing countries are slum dwellers. This number is expected to double by 2030, but governments and stakeholders of the international community have yet to come up with a strategy to accommodate this change. ""The discussion shouldn't be whether to lend a hand, but how,"" said Neal Peirce, winner of U.N.-Habitat's 2009 Scroll of Honor Award. In exploring some of the key challenges facing the urban development sector, the panelists highlighted the fact that urbanization has always been regarded as a ""messy public sector-oriented topic,"" with cities being ""crime and grime"" congestion zones that were to be ignored. Negative attitudes toward issues give rise to poor policy frameworks, which in turn reinforce the problems. Without a change in perceptions and political will, urban development policies are bound to fail. ""Why else would you have 13 people settling every hour in the city of Lagos [in Nigeria]?"" said Abha Joshi-Ghani, head of the World Bank's urban team. ""Because it offers them hope, it offers them life; it offers them opportunities, jobs and services, which don't exist in the rural areas."" Alongside access to jobs, urbanization could improve access to education, technology, health care, human rights and women's liberation. According to Joshi-Ghani, research from an upcoming World Bank urban strategy report indicates that urbanization happens primarily in secondary and small cities in developing countries, and not in big mega cities. With 70 percent of the world's gross domestic product coming from cities, the question of urbanization is strongly tied to that of growth and poverty reduction. It is therefore important for governments to develop policies, institutions and other regulatory frameworks in order to harness the potential of their cities. Through knowledge transfer between cities in developing countries, there is a greater chance of success. However, this does not mean that the U.S. has no mandate in assisting in the regulation of rapid urbanization.

4,62850,"World Bank revamps its urban strategy For the first time ever, half of the world is urbanized - but that’s not the only thing that’s new. More than 90 percent of rapid urbanization is taking place in mid-size cities with populations of up to a million, not the megacities that have been a traditional focus of urban developers, according to the World Bank. Much of this growth is based in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. “If we are not going to focus our resources, policy interventions and institutions on these cities, then they are also going to grow haphazardly. The slums are going to increase, there will be congestion, lack of services and so on,” said Abha Joshi-Ghani, the World Bank’s urban development manager who spearheaded the bank’s latest global strategy on urban development. The report, Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation, was launched in Singapore on Nov. 10 during the World Bank-Singapore Infrastructure Finance Summit, and is expected to guide the bank’s urban sector strategy in the years to come. Joshi-Ghani, an Oxford University graduate, first joined the World Bank as an infrastructure finance expert. As part of her job, she sought private-sector funding for infrastructure initiatives in developing countries and in 2002, she joined the bank’s urban team and shifted her focus to municipal finance. Moving from infrastructure to urban issues involved a steep learning curve. While her expertise in management and finance enabled her to understand many aspects of municipal finance and the delivery of city services, Joshi-Ghani had to learn about urban poverty and land regulations and how they impact cities. Devex caught up with Joshi-Ghani in Washington to discuss the report’s findings and how development organizations and professionals may respond to emerging trends in urbanization. Partnering with the World Bank on urban-sector projects Based on your experience and interactions with different partners, what can businesses do to contribute to the sector? We’re really looking at a lot of public-private partnerships in cities, in climate change. You have businesses like IBM, Cisco, General Electric and GDF Suez who are all looking at smart cities, smart networks. In terms of climate change, we’re looking at that. We’re also looking at energy efficiency in service provision. Service delivery in cities is another area where we feel that businesses can contribute through innovation, in the delivery of water to poorer areas, solid waste services. We have some really interesting examples. For example in Mumbai, India, we had the local private sector come in and put electricity connections in the slums. They were paid their cost plus profits but it only cost close to $10 per household, because we have these targeted subsidy mechanisms where we could really get the private sector to deliver on services. We find that - and this happens in the developed world as well - cities attract developers to do housing, but they need to provide certain numbers of low-income housing units, and they get certain tax breaks for providing those. We’re also looking at - and something Washington, D.C., is in process of doing - developing old river fronts for businesses, where it was felt that either it was a brown field that needed to be regenerated, or just local economic development, which we’ve been able to do in many cities in developing countries by attracting businesses, by actually enhancing the services to a particular area. For example, creating a fish market on the port of Yemen, which cleaned up the area [and] put up proper fish shops. The city earns a lot from it, but at the same time, you find that because of the facilities, more businesses are coming and it’s booming. Redevelopment of areas which were lying waste or unused, that’s one area that businesses can come into. We’re also doing drill-downs of neighborhoods where most businesses don’t locate because they think that there isn’t a thriving economy there. But if you do surveys and economic drill-downs you find that there is sufficient buying power or demand, for, let’s say, a nice large grocery store to go and locate in a poorer neighborhood so that the neighborhood is not just dependent on 7-Eleven and local stores where you only get tinned food and so on. This is just an example of grocery stores, of getting access to poorer neighborhoods through larger grocery stores where they can buy cheaper, eat fresher and eat healthier. This is just an example of how we attract businesses. What sort of organizations does the World Bank partner with on such projects? It’s extremely varied. Firstly, we would partner with the recipient of our investment - it could be a city, a state government, a financial institution, a development institution. We normally do tend to work in partnership with our developmental partners or donors, and that could come at certain levels. We could be partnering with the “Asian Development Bank”:, the African Development Bank, the U.N. Human Settlements Program, the U.N. Environmental Program, to name a few. Also, donor agencies such as the French Development Agency, or GTZ from Germany, DfID from the U.K. At one level it’s that. On another level, we also work with community-based organizations and non-governmental organizations. We like to work closely with them at the local level because we want to be sure that our projects have community participation, and the community actually has a voice in what we’re doing. We always like to see private-sector partnerships in this. It could be in terms of consultancies, suppliers, or financiers. There are private banks who have come in and co-financed with us. How do small and local organizations approach you? I am, specifically, in a central policy unit which doesn’t actually do projects. But in the regions which do projects and lending, there are many ways of approaching us. One is, you can always see which projects are ongoing or are going to be coming to bid. On the World Bank Web site [and on the Devex site, ed.] you can see what projects are going to the board, and if people feel that it’s something they would be interested in, they pick up the phone and call. I think a lot of people will just look at the World Bank Web site and say, “Oh this is something I’m interested in either in offering my services as a consultant, or my firm’s services as a provider of consultancy, finance or something,” and then they get touch with the people here. The World Bank is not difficult to contact at all, and we’re very responsive whenever anybody calls. It’s not that you write an e-mail and it never gets responded. A lot of them actually get in touch with the borrowing government. How to start a career in the urban sector What are some of the hot jobs in urban development? People who want to work in urban itself, I’d always suggest: Work for a city. It’s an exciting place to work and it’s a microcosm of just about everything. Especially in developing countries, we find that we don’t have enough capacity in cities because they are not able to attract urban planners, architects, municipal engineers and so on. If you have that skill, work for a city. Then there are lots of think tanks and other NGOs. In Washington, there are so many of them: the Urban Institute, the Brookings Institution, the International Housing Coalition. I would say that if you want to work on urban issues, the place to do it is to go work for a city first. What are some of the skills that are in high demand? We want urban economists, urban planners, and more and more, we’re looking at people who can work on urban environment. It’s a cross-sectoral skill but with cities and climate change, we’re looking at environmental engineers and specialists, and definitely people who specialize in municipal finance. We also look for architects. Which academic programs prepare one for entering the sector? The majority of people who work in urban are either urban planners or economists who specialize in urban economics, or from an engineering background. Environmental engineering, municipal engineering, civil engineering, and architects - those are the four most popular streams. The World Bank’s new urban strategy report What are the goals of the urban strategy report? A sector strategy would say how a sector has changed within the last ten years. What are the emerging issues and exactly what should we be doing differently? If we never actually evaluated that, or never captured the change and the trends, we couldn’t really be assisting our developing country partners at all. You just see how what was prevalent 15 years, right now seems completely archaic. What are the highlights and key messages in the report? For the first time, half of the world is urban. It’s a real benchmark here. And then, most of the urbanization is taking place in developing countries. For specific regions, Asia and Africa would double in the next 30 years. It’s not just the mega-cities, it’s happening in secondary cities. National governments need to look at a system of cities. How do mega-cities, secondary cities and small towns fit in this whole equation? What is also new is that it has been established through some good research that urbanization is linked to growth and poverty reduction. No country has reached middle-income status without urbanizing. Cities and climate change is a huge new issue for us. We weren’t talking about that in the strategy which came out in the year 2000. It doesn’t change the basic principles. In 2000 we came up with, a city has to be livable, it has to be bankable, it has to be well-managed and well-governed. Those principles will remain. But what we’re saying is that this is an urgent agenda. Cities need to do something, otherwise they will not be able to deliver services, housing to its citizens. There’ll be slums, they’ll not be able to attract businesses and therefore they’ll not have jobs. How did you go about developing the report? The process of writing or developing a strategy is a very consultative process. For us it’s not just sitting in our offices here, putting together a team, and saying: Oh, let’s do the new World Bank strategy. Our first immediate thing is we need to talk to our colleagues in the regions: What are the five or six key issues that you’ve noticed or that you’re dealing with in your set of countries? So that’s a first way of bringing in that information. A second thing is actually going to the countries themselves, and consulting and talking about it. This is what we’re doing: What do you think? What do you think the World Bank should be looking at? What are the key issues that you would want us to look at? Thirdly, we go to NGOs, community-based organizations and donor partners and say: What are the issues that you think are there? It’s a really big consulting process. We have a Web site which has various PowerPoints on what the strategy stands for. At every stage there was something there. We also had an interactive Web site, so you could go on the Web site and say: Well, you may be talking about x, y and z, but I live in Accra and this is what we think is important, and I don’t see that in your strategy. Or: You’re missing an issue. Or: You’re talking about issues which may be pertinent to Latin American countries and not Africa; we have different issues. It was an interactive process and we spoke at many forums, we went to annual meetings of a cities representative group called Union of Cities and Local Governments. It has about 1,000 to 2000 members, so we went and presented the strategy to them, and consulted with them. We went to programs organized by universities here; we really tried to cover the whole realm. What would you say were the key challenges in the entire process? One is, have we consulted enough? Have we left out any important view or constituency? Secondly, how do we distill these messages? And thirdly, how do we put these messages in such a way that we can actually implement and operationalize them? Something can look terrific on paper, but it means nothing when you say: Oh, I’m doing a project and I’d really like to do it according to what the World Bank has put in the strategy, and there’s nothing tangible there. And then, how do we monitor and evaluate ourselves on how we’re implementing the strategy?",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Devex caught up with Joshi-Ghani in Washington to discuss the report’s findings and how development organizations and professionals may respond to emerging trends in urbanization.

It could be in terms of consultancies, suppliers, or financiers. One is, you can always see which projects are ongoing or are going to be coming to bid. People who want to work in urban itself, I’d always suggest: Work for a city. What are the emerging issues and exactly what should we be doing differently? And then, most of the urbanization is taking place in developing countries. There’ll be slums, they’ll not be able to attract businesses and therefore they’ll not have jobs. It has about 1,000 to 2000 members, so we went and presented the strategy to them, and consulted with them.","The slums are going to increase, there will be congestion, lack of services and so on,” said Abha Joshi-Ghani, the World Bank’s urban development manager who spearheaded the bank’s latest global strategy on urban development. More than 90 percent of rapid urbanization is taking place in mid-size cities with populations of up to a million, not the megacities that have been a traditional focus of urban developers, according to the World Bank. We’re also looking at - and something Washington, D.C., is in process of doing - developing old river fronts for businesses, where it was felt that either it was a brown field that needed to be regenerated, or just local economic development, which we’ve been able to do in many cities in developing countries by attracting businesses, by actually enhancing the services to a particular area. We want urban economists, urban planners, and more and more, we’re looking at people who can work on urban environment. While her expertise in management and finance enabled her to understand many aspects of municipal finance and the delivery of city services, Joshi-Ghani had to learn about urban poverty and land regulations and how they impact cities. As part of her job, she sought private-sector funding for infrastructure initiatives in developing countries and in 2002, she joined the bank’s urban team and shifted her focus to municipal finance. I think a lot of people will just look at the World Bank Web site and say, “Oh this is something I’m interested in either in offering my services as a consultant, or my firm’s services as a provider of consultancy, finance or something,” and Partnering with the World Bank on urban-sector projects Based on your experience and interactions with different partners, what can businesses do to contribute to the sector? The majority of people who work in urban are either urban planners or economists who specialize in urban economics, or from an engineering background. Especially in developing countries, we find that we don’t have enough capacity in cities because they are not able to attract urban planners, architects, municipal engineers and so on.",1
5,63418,"EuropeAid Pushes ‘Results-Oriented Monitoring’ Evaluating field projects isn't easy. Sometimes, vague terms of reference may be to blame, Francesca Mosca said. EuropeAid's director of quality of operations talked with Devex about ways to ensure effective aid delivery. Mosca led the European Commission's delegation to Zimbabwe for four years before moving to Nicaragua to lead its Central America operations, from 2005 to 2008. Before that, she worked for the commission in areas such as food security and assistance, human rights, democracy, governance and cooperation with East and Central Africa. Devex spoke with Mosca about the problems her team faces when evaluating field projects - and complaints from partner organizations about the commission's very complex project application procedures. What obstacles, if any, does EuropeAid encounter when evaluating projects in the field? Projects are usually evaluated directly by our delegations. Here at headquarters, we mostly deal with thematic evaluations or with those in common with the Relex [External Relations] family. But when it comes to evaluating a project, it's our delegations who do that. Having said that, we found that our difficulties are maybe related to terms of reference, which are too generic or not very well expressed. So, in the end, evaluation is difficult and it doesn't produce the desired results. Sometimes, also, experts [evaluators] are not as qualified as we would want them to be. Sometimes there is no follow-up after our recommendations. What we do is use the recommendations we get after evaluating a project to modify our field operations. Although, this is not always the case. Sometimes [our projects] don't continue in the same sector, and our recommendations may not translate. This is why sometimes they are not observed. … But I would say difficulties are mostly due to excessively generic terms of reference and the quality of evaluators. Other difficulties we encounter are due to the fact that many evaluations are carried out ex-post, so sometimes technical personnel and partners who worked on a project are no longer there; therefore, it is difficult to access the entire documentation as we do when the project is still in place. But apart from evaluations, we also have another system named ROM [results-oriented monitoring]. This is a much-lighter procedure than an evaluation. It consists in very short missions of maximum three or four days, which we carry out while the project is still in place in order to evaluate whether it is well-organized and so that - should problems arise - they can be fixed by the commission. So, it is a much more agile tool, and it should be a management instrument. Do you think this easier procedure will be employed more and more often by EuropeAid? It has existed for some years already. I personally think it is a useful management tool, and because it is a useful management tool, its methodology should be employed by delegations, especially when they go verify and visit projects. If we could get to that point, I think we would obtain excellent results. I remember that when I was heading a delegation some results-oriented monitoring experts came, and we asked them to share their methodology with us because it would have been useful when we visited projects in the field. But there we have a human resources problem with the [small] number of people in some delegations, which have many vacant positions and we don't have enough personnel. We spoke about the difficulties encountered by EuropeAid in the evaluation of field projects. Are there any obstacles partners in the field complain about? Answering this question is really easy. Partners in the field always tell us the commission is not flexible and fast enough, and our procedures are too complex. For organizations operating in the field, which are often local partners, it is difficult to respond and start projects according to our calls, which are published online [as well as on the Devex Web site, the editor]. Complying with all of our requirements is really complicated. Is EuropeAid considering easing its procedures in response to these complaints? I think easing the procedures should always be among our aims. Since I've been working here and even when I worked in the delegations, I always heard about work groups trying to ease the procedures. My experience, though, showed me we haven't been able to do much. But it is not only us. The [European] Council takes part in the setting of the financial regulation. It is not adopted by the commission. It is only presented by the commission to the member states. So, all we can do is ease the procedures within that context and ensure the observation of the financial regulation. We cannot do more than that. How can current and potential partners stay up-to-date on collaboration opportunities offered by EuropeAid? If we talk about non-governmental partners, they normally send projects when we launch a call for applications. They [calls] are always advertised on the commission's or EuropeAid's Web site. So, they are always informed about them. Are there any areas in which EuropeAid is particularly focusing when it comes to partnering opportunities? There are a number of thematic areas in which we operate. ""Human rights"" is one of them, as well as ""investing in people"" or ""asylum and migration."" So, there are several thematic lines, including the ""food facility,"" and they [partner organizations] can send projects within all of them. Some calls [for projects] are based here in Brussels, others are decentralized where delegations are.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"What obstacles, if any, does EuropeAid encounter when evaluating projects in the field?

10,82918,"'Enabling environment' for private sector to tap Africa's energy potential How can the private sector be brought on board to help Africa meet its energy needs? By creating the right “enabling environment” for robust private sector investment. That is, according to EuropeAid Deputy Director-General for Policy and Thematic Coordination Klaus Rudischhauser who spoke with Devex after the Second High-Level Meeting of the Africa-EU Energy Partnership held last week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. READ: How to ‘power’ Africa: A trillion dollar question? That would include wide-ranging reforms on policy and regulatory frameworks, he explained, which Brussels would support by making a case for development through energy. “Energy allows businesses to grow. If businesses want to expand, they will need energy,” Rudischhauser said. “But fostering businesses is not a goal just by itself … The real challenge will be to provide the necessary growth in order to absorb the increase in population that Africa will face in the coming decades.” And not only that — unlocking the country’s energy potential would include renewables and thus reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the long-term, altering the mix and perhaps even leaving enough to export to Europe in the future, the EuropeAid official added. Here are more highlights from our conversation: How has the Second High Level Meeting of the AEEP helped shape a forward-looking vision for energy cooperation between Africa and Europe? This … meeting has been crucial in terms of bringing together partners to see how best we can achieve our goal of sustainable energy for all. Throughout the meeting, participants have stressed that energy is key for growth and development. People and countries are eager to share experiences and even more eager to learn. The AEEP provides the perfect platform to do just this. It can help to address bottlenecks through shared experience, both African and European, and can draw on expertise from a variety of partners — it’s really unique in the development sector. So what is your main takeaway from the meeting? I’d say that in future we may have to be more focused in our discussions and concentrate on concrete topics, such as how to include the private sector in rural electrification, or on the necessary regulatory framework that can foster an active energy sector. I’m convinced that this should help countries and companies to develop concrete projects that can then be proposed for financing from the appropriate financing instrument — whether it’s a European one, or one from another donor. And how will you foster an enabling environment for the private sector? The private sector — especially the local African private sector — has an essential role to play and there’s a clear need for an enabling environment. One of the recommendations of the communiqué adopted during the meeting highlights the need to continue the implementation of reforms on policy and regulatory frameworks in Africa, creating an enabling environment for private investments. It’s clear that the private sector will be essential in contributing to the achievement of the AEEP targets. But how will this vision be translated into a workable roadmap towards the achievement of concrete results? In terms of next steps, in less than two months’ time, leaders from Europe and Africa will come together in Brussels for the Fourth Africa-EU Summit. This will be our opportunity to take stock of our achievements and agree on our shared priorities for the next stage in our partnership. European Commissioner for Development Andris Piebalgs stated at the meeting that “no energy means no development.” Can we therefore expect energy security to be a cross-cutting theme and/or a funding priority in the next programming period? Commissioner Piebalgs has always had a strong commitment to improving access to sustainable energy for all and has been instrumental in the [United Nations’] Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Just last week, for example, he announced a further €5 million for the renewable energy cooperation program, in support of the 2020 objectives agreed in Vienna [at the First High Level Meeting in 2010], namely to provide energy access to an additional 100 million people across Africa, to double cross-border electricity capacity, to significantly increase the use of renewable energy and to improve energy efficiency. Look, the Commission has played a precursory role in stressing the need for energy in development — this was made clear during the First High Level Meeting in Vienna in 2010, and was reconfirmed in the Agenda for Change in 2011. Then in 2012, we hosted the EU Energy for All Summit in Brussels, where [Commission] President Barroso set the EU the ambitious target of helping developing countries to provide 500 million people with access to sustainable energy services by 2030. We’re now putting all these recommendations into concrete actions, mobilizing more than half a billion euros for energy over the past two years. And this effort will substantially increase in the coming programming period, where more than 25 countries have indicated a desire to focus on energy in our bilateral cooperation. And of course, energy is a prominent sector in our future regional and thematic programs. And will the issue be prioritized at the post-2015 framework talks later this year? Yes, energy is likely to be one of the key themes at the post-2015 framework talks. Without energy there can be no development, so it’s fundamental that the appropriate linkages between energy and other areas — poverty eradication, food and water security, health, gender equality and human rights — should be given proper consideration in the post-2015 agenda. Europe stands ready to support Africa in its quest to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth for the benefit of its growing population. Energy is key to growth, so I’m convinced that our partnership in energy will become even more important in the coming years. Back in 2010, at the First High-Level Meeting of the Energy Partnership, African and EU ministers set ambitious targets in the areas of energy access, energy security, renewable energy and energy efficiency to be reached by 2020. Despite solar energy capacity being likely to exceed its original target, what progress is being made to ensure that targets for other energy sources remain on track? The status report that was presented during the High-Level Meeting seemed to indicate that the target on energy access may also be within reach, but obviously more needs to be done in order to achieve real growth and development. The meeting also showed that countries that put in place sound policies and opened up their markets are able to show impressive results. Depending on the resources of the country, of course, this can even lead to an increase in electrification of 70 percent in 25 years. Such results may not be achievable everywhere, but the EU stands ready to assist our partners and, where possible, to help them find solutions to the gaps, wherever they arise. The EU aims to play a supporting role to enhance regulatory and investment frameworks. How are you stating the business case for development through energy? Energy allows businesses to grow. If businesses want to expand, they will need energy. Farmers need energy for processing and cooling for preservation, craftsmen need energy to drive their tools, training centers need energy for computers and so on. In its report on Financing Access for the Poor, the International Energy Agency indicated that an investment of $48 billion a year is needed in order to achieve universal access by 2030. So it’s clear that official development assistance alone will not do it — we also need massive support from the private sector. If we look at the mobile telecom revolution that Africa has gone through in the past decade, there’s no reason why it should not be possible in the energy sector too. But fostering businesses is not a goal just by itself. This energy will be greatly needed in order to create jobs for young people. The real challenge will be to provide the necessary growth in order to absorb the increase in population that Africa will face in the coming decades. These jobs can be developed only through the development of small and medium enterprises at local level, fostering grass root development and creating sustainable long-term growth. And giving rise to independent power producers? Yes, the energy sector in itself generates business, such as IPPs at local level that need to rely on a stable enabling environment for their investments to grow. In addition, investments in renewable and energy efficiency solutions in turn generate higher qualified jobs, developing the capacity and technical skills required at local level. In order to foster the boost for private investment, governments — from their side — will have to provide an enabling regulatory framework for operational and cost-effective utilities, while international donors have put into action risk-mitigation instruments to close the investment gap. With its vast and largely untapped natural resources, Africa is an ideal place to develop innovative technologies and renewable energy solutions. If it can fulfil its potential, does the continent represent an energy security solution for the EU? I’m convinced that realizing the full potential of renewable energy in Africa is truly a win-win solution. When 70 percent of Africans rely on traditional biomass for their basic energy needs, we should not only think in terms of energy security, but also in terms of climate change, basic health for women and children, and the preservation of the natural habitat. I have already pointed toward the fact that energy also needs to provide the necessary growth for future generations. If we don’t, it is difficult to foresee the consequences. Renewable energy — and energy in general — can also bring countries together by integrating markets and harmonizing standards and procedures, therefore creating stability and an environment conducive to peace. But unlocking the vast potential of renewable energy will also reduce the need for fossil fuels, and thus alleviate pressure on the international markets, which is not only beneficial for Europe, but for the entire world. If additionally there would be room for export to Europe, this can only be beneficial in the context of the current fuel and energy mix. But do you fear that engagement today may lead to a conflict of interests tomorrow? No, we don’t see a conflict of interest here. Africa is a young continent open to technology and innovation, so investing in innovative solutions in renewable energy can only be beneficial for both continents.

But fostering businesses is not a goal just by itself … The real challenge will be to provide the necessary growth in order to absorb the increase in population that Africa will face in the coming decades. And not only that — unlocking the country’s energy potential would include renewables and thus reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the long-term, altering the mix and perhaps even leaving enough to export to Europe in the future, the EuropeAid official added. And how will you foster an enabling environment for the private sector? In terms of next steps, in less than two months’ time, leaders from Europe and Africa will come together in Brussels for the Fourth Africa-EU Summit. Then in 2012, we hosted the EU Energy for All Summit in Brussels, where [Commission] President Barroso set the EU the ambitious target of helping developing countries to provide 500 million people with access to sustainable energy services by 2030. And of course, energy is a prominent sector in our future regional and thematic programs. Yes, energy is likely to be one of the key themes at the post-2015 framework talks. If we look at the mobile telecom revolution that Africa has gone through in the past decade, there’s no reason why it should not be possible in the energy sector too. Africa is a young continent open to technology and innovation, so investing in innovative solutions in renewable energy can only be beneficial for both continents.","Just last week, for example, he announced a further €5 million for the renewable energy cooperation program, in support of the 2020 objectives agreed in Vienna [at the First High Level Meeting in 2010], namely to provide energy access to an additional 100 million people across Africa, to double cross-border electricity capacity, to significantly increase the use of renewable energy and to improve energy efficiency. Back in 2010, at the First High-Level Meeting of the Energy Partnership, African and EU ministers set ambitious targets in the areas of energy access, energy security, renewable energy and energy efficiency to be reached by 2020. Without energy there can be no development, so it’s fundamental that the appropriate linkages between energy and other areas — poverty eradication, food and water security, health, gender equality and human rights — should be given proper consideration in the post-2015 agenda. Then in 2012, we hosted the EU Energy for All Summit in Brussels, where [Commission] President Barroso set the EU the ambitious target of helping developing countries to provide 500 million people with access to sustainable energy services by 2030. When 70 percent of Africans rely on traditional biomass for their basic energy needs, we should not only think in terms of energy security, but also in terms of climate change, basic health for women and children, and the preservation of the natural habitat. Despite solar energy capacity being likely to exceed its original target, what progress is being made to ensure that targets for other energy sources remain on track? The status report that was presented during the High-Level Meeting seemed to indicate that the target on energy access may also be within reach, but obviously more needs to be done in order to achieve real growth and development. And not only that — unlocking the country’s energy potential would include renewables and thus reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the long-term, altering the mix and perhaps even leaving enough to export to Europe in the future, the EuropeAid official added.

11,83057,"Online platform unlocks knowledge stream for WASH BPN 2.0 is an online platform created to help organizations in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector collaborate, share ideas and give feedback to each other, and better plan, manage, track and evaluate their work. When the Community Water Center started developing a community-driven solution to providing clean, arsenic- and pesticide-free water to southern California’s San Joaquin Valley, it found help from a project implemented half a world away. Project Well has been working to provide arsenic-free water to communities in West Bengal in eastern India and neighboring areas in Bangladesh for years. In 2007, the nonprofit joined the Blue Planet Run Foundation, which not only provided funding for 20 dug wells but also gave Project Well a platform to manage, track and analyze on-the-ground data. The platform, called Peer Water Exchange, did more than just manage the nonprofit’s projects; it also housed the organization’s project plans, which were reviewed by other members of the Blue Planet Run network. These plans proved valuable to Community Water Center. Instead of starting from scratch, CWC learned from Project Well’s experience and was able to do a better and more effective program “right off the bat,” Lisa Nash, the executive director of the foundation now known as Blue Planet Network, said. For years, knowledge sharing has been deemed “a crucial part of development” and helped countries respond better to disasters, improve conditional cash transfer programs and even develop export manufacturing supply chains. Nonetheless, there remain a lot of data and knowledge that stay within an organization, partly because there is no convenient way to share and collaborate but in large part because such information is often deemed confidential. “There are unfortunately many nonprofits that are outstanding at the work they do but they don’t want to share it with anybody because they are worried if they share their ideas other people will take them and use them,” Nash said. BPN, which is now a division of East Meets West, aimed to be different. Based in Silicon Valley, BPN leveraged its strength in technology development and created a system where implementers can craft sustainable, well-thought-out projects and funders can find projects worth supporting. Peer Water Exchange was developed as a forum to do all that. Launched in 2006, the online platform was created to help organizations in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector collaborate, share ideas and give feedback to each other, and better plan, manage, track and evaluate their work. What started as a network of five organizations has grown to a roster of 109 members working on WASH projects in 27 countries worldwide. Implementers, which can only join following a referral and peer review from existing members of the network, post their project proposals online. The form asks questions that are required from all projects and members, such as: ▪ What’s your planning process? ▪ What’s the problem you are trying to solve? ▪ What are you proposing to do? ▪ How are you proposing to monitor it? ▪ How are you going to work with the community to ensure the project is sustainable over the long term? Once the proposal is online, members with relevant experience and knowledge ask the implementer follow-up questions to gauge feasibility, point out holes and provide as much constructive feedback as possible. The implementer can then modify the proposal, following the peer review, and resubmit the project plan. Members then rate the amended proposal from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest — meaning, the project has “all the ingredients to be sustainable over the long term.” Funders may find the platform useful too. “A lot of time, foundations and individuals will come to us and say, ‘We’re interested in funding water and sanitation projects around the world but we don’t have the staff to tell us what’s good’,” Nash said. BPN makes it easier for such funders to find the projects to finance, and Nash believes the peer reviews can help reduce time spent figuring out what’s a good group to support. Once projects get the funding they need, implementers on the ground then send updates using a ubiquitous tool: cellphones. And while it certainly can develop an app for this purpose, BPN chose to have updates sent via text messaging as the majority of its members still use basic cellphones. “We have a very simple service that we offer to our members and they’re able to text in field updates or comments they want to make or metrics and they get uploaded to our platform on their project page,” Nash said. Members can update and track whenever they want, and BPN charts the data so that they can see, visually, how their projects are progressing. Members are not the only ones that listen to feedback. Responding to member requests, the nonprofit recently launched BPN 2.0, a revamped platform that now makes it easier for implementers and funders to see everything they need to see about their projects, at a glance. There are separate dashboards for implementers and funders, but the format is the same. Project status updates are categorized according to water, sanitation and hygiene, and are color-coded. Green means the project is progressing according to plan, yellow means some aspects are being reported late and red means the project is not working well at all. But although BPN’s platform fosters healthy knowledge sharing among peers, there is no verification system in place and members have to trust implementers on the ground are reporting accurate information. Members, or even BPN, may sometimes visit their peers’ projects when they are in the area. When they do, their updates are sent to that implementer’s project page as well. “We would love to have a third party to come in and do third-party verification,” Nash said. BPN is currently in talks with organizations such as Engineers Without Borders, Rotary International and the Peace Corps to see whether they can come in to verify progress at project sites.

12,83337,"‘Get things right in Africa and the private sector will come’ The potential for private sector investments in Africa is huge — and the massive financing gap on the continent is not as hard to fill as some might think. “Filling the financing gap is quite easy: get things right by creating a regulatory environment that is conducive for the private sector, and the private sector will come,"" Bruno Wenn, CEO of the German Investment Corp. and chairman of the Association of European Development Finance Institutions, told Devex on the sidelines of the recent EU-Africa Business Forum in Brussels. The forum, which brought together African and European business leaders, convened a high-level platform to discuss how to use the EU-Africa partnership for meeting today’s development challenges. Wenn shared his views about the role private sector investments can play on the African continent. Here are some highlights from our conversation: EDFI focuses on developing the private sector in emerging and developing economies. What is the potential role for new development implementers? There are a lot of new opportunities because countries in Africa are changing ... We have seen it in Senegal, when five years ago the government changed the energy law, for the first time allowing the private sector to generate, distribute and transmit power, as well as feed power into the system. This has deployed the huge potential of private sector investments, allowing investors [to participate in] local private investments to provide renewable energy in very remote rural areas. There is also huge potential in Uganda, because the government has introduced investment-friendly regulation. In Uganda today, there are cost-reflective tariffs, as well as PPPs and power purchase agreements that are recognized as being safe procedures between private energy producers and the public sector off-takers ... [in] South Africa last year the energy law was completely revised, more or less replicating the systems of Latin America. Now they are [launching] new tenders so that the private sector can propose and renew projects, subject to some pre-set conditions, which has generated huge interest among the private sector. Another example is Kenya, where we have already tested a power purchasing agreement. There are also huge opportunities in West Africa — in Nigeria and Ivory Coast, for example — where governments last year liberalized and privatized a large part of the energy sector, and are [now] calling for private sector bio projects. So is regulation the main obstacle for further private sector involvement, or is it stability? In the energy sector, out of 54 countries in Africa, only a handful have a regulatory framework in place that is conducive to private sector investments. I don’t believe that Africa is a continent full of risk. We have to recognize that over the past 10 years, Africa has achieved the highest economic growth worldwide and has significantly progressed in terms of good governance and in tackling corruption. Africa has achieved a lot to improve the business climate: eight out of the 10 best performers for doing business in recent years have been African countries. The good developments in the continent aren't being adequately recognized by business people in industrialized countries. For us it is easier to assist companies from Latin America than convince German business people to invest in Africa. All the emerging countries are investing in Africa … but industrialized countries continue to see Africa as a land of risk and not a land of opportunity, unfortunately. How can this mindset change, and what role will the private sector play in the post-2015 framework in this regard? A relevant one. I am extremely happy that more and more governments and also the European Commission recognize the private sector as a key player when it comes to development, in order to create jobs, increase growth and reduce poverty. I see a lot of opportunities even in the social sectors, such as the health sector, the education sector and the water sector, where the private sector can be very helpful, not only in terms of financing but also in providing skills and know-how. But is the private sector being harnessed sufficiently to fill gaps in official development assistance? To be honest with you, I don’t believe in ODA any more. Now, I am very much convinced that for developing countries to become more independent, it would be more useful to look on the private sector not only in terms of foreign direct investments, but also take into consideration the local private investors. Africa is full of informal businesses. Helping them to get access to long-term financing and to simplify accounting standards would lead them to grow and become more formal. As a German citizen, I strongly believe in SMEs, which provide huge opportunities. Another sector completely ignored — or not fully understood — is agriculture. Africa is the only continent that has huge underused or unused potential. Africa could feed the world, if properly done, so we have to increase the productivity, increase mechanizations, increase infrastructure, skills and local financing. Business people should consider Africa as a business harbor. Are there any emerging sectors that will attract African investment in the coming years? Africa is investing heavily in cyber systems, which provide opportunities for IT companies to build up their services. I am convinced that in the years to come we will see a growing industry producing software. We also need to provide more support to SMEs [in this sector], because if they have access to simplified accounting standards for software, it will be easier for the banks to give them loans ... More and more people are investing in IT systems, services and making more of the mobile phone use available. This will certainly be a growing industry ... People in Africa are starting to use modern technology through the Internet to sell products, just as Asians and Latin Americans are doing. And through the Internet, we’ll soon be able to provide education services even in very remote areas ... Today Africa is a place to go as a business person, not only as a tourist.

13,83426,"PPPs future of Asia-Pacific infrastructure development — ADB Famous Spanish painter Pablo Picasso once said that “action is the foundational key to all success” — a statement that perfectly portrays not just art but also the field of international development, where words (policies and promises) have usually overpowered action (efforts and results). This is something the Asian Development Bank is keen on moving away from by having everyone — particularly the private sector — involved in Asia-Pacific’s development through more partnerships and collaboration. One example is the public-private partnership scheme. ADB President Takehiko Nakao believes PPPs are “essential” not only in providing the region with much-needed capital but also in instituting knowledge-sharing processes from the private sector to the communities, and vice versa. “A strong private sector is essential for development. It can fill large investment gaps, create jobs and reduce poverty,” Nakao said on Friday in his opening address at the bank’s annual meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan. “In this regard, we will expand our support for public-private partnerships … [to] help mobilize more private sector investment and improve the delivery of public services.” One of the biggest development challenges that ADB is facing today is Asia-Pacific’s huge demand for investment in infrastructure development, almost $800 billion annually for the next ten years — which cannot be addressed by either the public or the private sector on its own, according to a senior bank official. “We need collaboration between private and public players to make things work, and to bring critical services to the community,” said Michael Barrow, ADB deputy director general for private sector operations. PPPs and other forms of partnerships are one of the key focus areas in ADB’s long-term “Strategy 2020,” as well as one of the main buzz topics at the annual meeting. Next steps Aside from additional finance, PPPs can bridge development gaps in terms of knowledge due to the private sectors’ technical know-how, by making these initiatives and projects more effective and cutting-edge, as well as increase accountability. In one of the seminars in Astana, panelists agreed that this form of collaboration can also play a crucial role in helping countries with previously centralized economies like Myanmar to transition to private-sector oriented free market systems. The Manila-based institution, however, clarified that adopting the PPP scheme is not just a simple shoutout. Several policy decisions should be implemented for it to become successful including tax incentives and ease of business processes, among others. “To foster strong PPPs, they need to provide incentives and the right climate for private investments,” ADB explained. “Asian economies need to ensure that PPP projects are developed and delivered in professional, informed ways.” This risk was underlined by Woochong Um, the bank’s sustainable development deputy director general, when he said that PPPs “can be a useful solution” although “sometimes it’s not” due to the inconsistent results in various cases for the past couple of years. ADB will be expected to encourage and advise several developing member countries to gradually craft and implement PPP-friendly policies to pave the way for more private sector — local and foreign — participation in development projects in the region. Pros and cons Some of the concerns raised in engaging the private sector in development work include a tug-of-war of interests between people and profit and ethical considerations in doing business, among others. For instance, several months ago a Japanese infrastructure firm was involved in a bribery and corruption scandal to win development contracts in Vietnam and Indonesia. These are the issues that need to be addressed looking ahead, not just on the part of the private sector but also in terms of monitoring and cross-checking from the multilateral lending entities like the bank. “ADB should further increase its institutional efficiency and effectiveness. Instead of taking a business as usual attitude, we should be more innovative by reforming our business processes and by revisiting the risk return profile of our private sector operations,” Nakao noted in his speech. When asked by Devex in February if there’s any development area the private sector should not be involved, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah said there’s none. But, as stated above, getting the private sector involved is not always a happy story. So what are the risks? According to the World Bank, costs in bidding out and implementing PPP projects may actually be higher than traditional government procurement processes, and there are sometimes added costs attached to the agreement at hand. “While private sector can make it easier to get finance, finance can only be available where the operating cash flows of the project company are expected to provide a return on investment,” the Washington, D.C.-based institution explained in a recent study. This also links to the idea that these private firms may have a very different view of their objectives than the aid agencies. The World Bank said that “some projects may be more politically or socially challenging to introduce or implement” and that they will do what they are told to do and “no more than that” — which do not always bode well in the objective of addressing humanitarian concerns.

14,85776,"Aid to water supply and sanitation: Where the money is going The U.N. General Assembly declared March 22 as World Water Day in 1993, but it was only in 2010 when, through a resolution that rallied donors and international organizations to help developing countries gain access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation, the organization recognized access to water supply and sanitation as a human right. Just a year before water supply and sanitation was officially named a human right by the United Nations, aid to the sector peaked at $6.8 billion. Disbursements dropped to $5.4 billion in 2010 and $5.1 billion in 2011, but rebounded to $6.3 billion in 2012. In 2013, the latest year for which official development assistance figures are available from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, water supply and sanitation assistance was at $5.7 billion — slightly higher than 2010 and 2011 levels. While aid to the water supply and sanitation sector has not been a drop in the bucket, commitments have far exceeded disbursements. For example, in 2013, donors committed $9.7 billion to the sector — nearly $4 billion more than the actual disbursed amount for water supply and sanitation that year. Below, we take a closer look at ODA to the water sector in 2013. Water supply comprised the bulk of aid commitments OECD breaks down aid to the water supply and sanitation sector into 11 areas: water resources policy and administrative management, water resources protection, large water supply and sanitation systems, large water supply systems, large sanitation systems, basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation, basic drinking water supply, basic sanitation, river development, waste management and disposal, and education and training in water supply and sanitation. In 2013, a huge chunk of water commitments — $2.1 billion, or 22 percent — went to potable water treatment plants, water supply pumping stations and large-scale conveyance and distribution systems. The smallest share of aid commitments went to education and training in water supply and sanitation, which received $68 million in commitments, or a mere 0.71 percent of total committed assistance to the sector that year. Traditional donors dominate — but emerging donors are catching up Japan, the World Bank, Germany, the European Union and the United States are the top five donors to water supply and sanitation in 2013. The United Arab Emirates and South Korea, however, gave at least $370 million to the sector and even eclipsed France and the African Development Bank in terms of disbursements that year. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, while not among the top donors to the sector, still disbursed a significant $69 million in 2013. Early this year, the foundation garnered attention for its work on water supply and sanitation when Bill Gates drank water processed by the Omniprocessor, a compact waste treatment plant developed by Janicki Bionergy that can turn sewage into high-grade drinking water. Lower-middle-income economies are the largest recipients Several of the top recipients of water assistance commitments — India, Morocco, Vietnam, Zambia, Egypt and Sri Lanka — are lower-middle-income economies. Bangladesh, Mozambique and Mali are the few low-income countries among the largest recipients. Tunisia, which has achieved the highest access rates to water and sanitation in the Middle East and North Africa, is the sole upper-middle-income economy on the list. In India, where water supply and sanitation remains a persistent problem, the World Bank ($539 million) and Japan ($187.2 million) had the most commitments to the sector.

In 2013, a huge chunk of water commitments — $2.1 billion, or 22 percent — went to potable water treatment plants, water supply pumping stations and large-scale conveyance and distribution systems. Aid to water supply and sanitation: Where the money is going The U.N. General Assembly declared March 22 as World Water Day in 1993, but it was only in 2010 when, through a resolution that rallied donors and international organizations to help developing countries gain access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation, the organization recognized access to water supply and sanitation as a human right. The smallest share of aid commitments went to education and training in water supply and sanitation, which received $68 million in commitments, or a mere 0.71 percent of total committed assistance to the sector that year. Early this year, the foundation garnered attention for its work on water supply and sanitation when Bill Gates drank water processed by the Omniprocessor, a compact waste treatment plant developed by Janicki Bionergy that can turn sewage into high-grade drinking water.

15,86055,"Research and communications are symbiotic Within organizations, there can be tension between those doing the research and those doing communications work. Which team leads and which follows? How do they work together in a way that makes sense? And is it possible for researchers to also serve as advocates? For me, research is a means to an end, either to answer a question or to figure out the right question to ask. I am motivated by the possibility that my work will make a difference to some of the billions of people who are much less fortunate than I am. And so I believe that good researchers can be good advocates. There is nothing inconsistent about being dispassionate about the research process while being passionate about communicating the findings in ways people can understand. Evidence-driven policy generation is the goal, but you have to have safeguards against exclusively policy-driven evidence generation. High-quality research must be rigorous (will people believe you?), original (does it advance thinking in the field?) and relevant (will people want to use it?). Too often, researchers only equate quality with rigor. We also have to take into consideration who will be reading our research. As an economist writing about hunger and nutrition, I’m most worried about how nutritionists will view my work. One of the things I like about nutrition is that it takes you into every nook and cranny of development: poverty, education, agriculture, governance, conflict, climate, HIV, social capital — you name it. I have a broad set of interests and nutrition is a way to focus them in a way that is tangible and human. Last November, the International Food Policy Research Institute released the first Global Nutrition Report for which I was lead author. It has been successful, downloaded more times than the 2014 World Development Report. How did we do it? Holding a launch event at ICN2 in Rome was a way to get both quality and quantity in uptake. By quality, I mean that we could target the key decision-makers and invite them to participate in roundtable discussions. And we had both an independent expert group and stakeholder group that helped with the concept, writing and dissemination of the report, which proved invaluable. The roundtable discussions — held in such places as London, New Delhi, Mexico City, Washington, D.C., Addis Ababa, Jakarta, Lusaka, New York and Tokyo — provided a good way to engage with national media, getting stories in daily newspapers and on websites. Blogs and tweets months before and after the launch in Rome also helped build awareness of the report’s existence and stimulated demand. Translating the report into languages, including French, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese, also helped us reach diverse audiences. Of course some of the burden of doing outreach on such reports falls on the researcher. I enjoy blogging and tweeting. Writing a regular blog helps me to be brief, use plain language and be a bit more playful. It also forces me to read more widely than I normally would and helps me to organize my thoughts. I blog once or twice a week and tweet two or three times a day. Tweeting is a way of sharing links related to new articles, papers, reports and meetings. Following key tweeters helps me stay on top of the buzz. I became a development researcher because I have an aptitude for research, but also because I am idealistic. The existence of billions of hungry and malnourished people is a grave injustice, one that research can help counteract. But you have to learn your research craft before you can leverage it. My view is that in the first 10-15 years post-doctorate, you should focus on building your own profile as a researcher. In the second 10-15 years, you should help build the profile and depth of your field, and the next 10-15 you really should invest big-time in your institution. For those first 10-15 years, worry more about rigor and originality. After that, it is a more even balance between rigor, originality and relevance. You won’t be able to balance these three in any one paper or report but, as a portfolio of work, you should try to publish in top-line places such as the Economic Journal or the Lancet, in more policy-focused journals, and in a series of nonpeer-reviewed publications, which are more widely read than journal articles. Whatever you do, wherever you are in your career cycle, you always have to worry about quality. Once we lose that, we lose all chance of influence. But worrying about quality is no excuse for not worrying about relevance, influence and impact. We have a moral obligation to have as positive an impact on people’s lives as we possibly can.

18,87270,"Effective altruism: Are you doing good, better? During a recent discussion on effective altruism, a friend shared she’s spending approximately $7 a month for Ratricia, a Gambian pouched rat under training by Belgian nonprofit Apopo to detect landmines in Tanzania. The commitment was personal: The giver is an animal lover. She also thinks demining is a neglected issue, and finds the strategy employed by Apopo as seemingly low-cost and high impact. This is the same across all her charitable givings; she donates to the Free Yezidi Foundation as a way to help the thousands singled out by the Islamic State group in Sinjar, Iraq, as well as to UNICEF to meet her desire to help children in need. Charity Navigator had an influence on her decision to donate to UNICEF, however. After conducting further research on the U.N. agency, she found in its annual report that most of the money (more than 90 percent) it receives is spent on programming. This would mean it, as per the charity evaluator’s criteria, likely has higher efficiency than those spending more than 30 percent of their budget on overhead. But which of these qualifies as “effective altruism?” Devex took a look at the latest in the evidence- and reason-driven movement. First, let’s define effective altruism. Peter Singer, the man behind the viral book “The Life You Can Save,” and one of the key figures in the effective altruism movement, describes it as giving using one’s heart and mind. That means that you don’t just contribute to any animal charity, for example, just because it recently Tweeted a photo of a dog in a wheelchair — though it may have moved you. You also have to consider whether the money you’re giving to that charity would have the most impact in terms of saving animals’ lives. You could use a little math for this — most aspiring effective altruists do. In this PSI Impact interview with Singer for the Best Buys in Global Health campaign with PATH and Devex, for example, the professor, who teaches bioethics at Princeton University, computes how best a person can make use of his or her money. “If you give $10,000 to a charity that spends $5,000 for each life saved, when you could have given it to one that spends $1,000 for each life saved, you’ve effectively wasted $8,000 of your donation. You’ve also allowed eight lives to be lost needlessly,” he said. Of course it’s not that simple. Just because you can buy more insecticide-treated bed nets with the money you have, and therefore save more lives by preventing more people from getting malaria, doesn’t mean it’s the right choice over pouring your money into research that looks to develop new drugs to treat tuberculosis. So how do you choose then where to direct your money? Effectivealtruism.org poses three key questions aspiring effective altruists usually ask themselves when deciding on a cause to support: 1. Will my contribution “drastically” save or improve more lives? 2. Can it make a “measurable difference”? 3. How much attention — or lack of it — has this cause received? But who to give to? Those that involve themselves with the effective altruism movement have flagged specific causes or charities they believe people should be supporting, given these charities’ record of cost-effectiveness. Most likely, these are charities evaluated and given top marks by GiveWell, a nonprofit that conducts in-depth research to find the best charities — backed by evidence — for donors to channel funding to. But don’t be surprised if you don’t find your favorite cause on the list: The charities recommended by GiveWell fall in certain categories covered in its priority programs, seven of which are recently reviewed: conditional and unconditional cash transfers, bed net distribution, deworming, salt iodization, vitamin A supplementation, and immunization against maternal and neonatal tetanus. This doesn’t mean, however, that the cause or charity you believe in isn’t worthy. GiveWell’s disclaimer: “The charities we don't recommend may be doing great work, and our lack of recommendation shouldn't be taken as evidence to the contrary.” There are other platforms that are similar to GiveWell in recommending charities donors should donate to, like Giving What We Can and The Life You Can Save, although you’ll likely find the same charities — Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, DeWorm the World Initiative — and then some. It all boils down to how “wisely” you donate your money? No, not exactly. It also takes into account how “wisely” you spend your time to make the most difference. Many may have answered this call by shifting to a humanitarian career, or by getting involved in a charity or an organization doing development work. But the people behind 80,000 Hours, a nonprofit that provides advice on careers you can choose to be able to make the “most social impact,” who are also key players in the effective altruism movement, are strongly advocating for you not to abandon your professional career just yet — you may actually get more things done if you stay in that marketing firm, or better yet, on Wall Street. “Many people should seriously consider “earning to give,” which is deliberately taking a lucrative career in order to do good by your donations rather than deliberately working somewhere where you could have a direct, immediate impact,” co-founder William MacAskill said in an interview with Vox Politics. So if I do all these I’d become an effective altruist? It depends on your calculations, how well you do your math (an example is total utility x probability to be achieved = expected utility gained per dollar spent, as per Singer), and of course, on what the term “effective” means to you. Humanitarian activist Dan Pallotta for one thinks a charity’s overhead costs is a poor indicator of efficiency. “We should stop saying charities with low ratios are efficient,” he wrote in this Harvard Business Review blog in 2009, and then goes on to make his case. “Say Jonas Salk spent $50 million to raise $100 million to find a polio vaccine. The admin:program ratio would report he had a shameful 50 percent overhead. But the $100 million he raised wasnʼt his end result. His end result was a vaccine. Divide the $50 million fundraising expense into the God-only-knows-how-many billions of dollars a polio vaccine is worth, and his overhead ratio at eradicating polio is 0 percent.” That’s more efficient, Pallotta argued, than a charity with a fundraising cost of only 10 percent, but a failed vaccine. Giving What We Can’s Toby Ord’s argument on cost-effectiveness in global health interventions meanwhile may raise a few eyebrows, especially to those allergic to the phrase “redirecting funds”: “If we can save 1,000 lives with one intervention and 10,000 with another at an equal price, then merely moving our funding from the first to the second saves 9,000 lives,” he concluded in this piece originally posted on the GivingWell website. It all depends on whose school of thought you ascribe to: Several prominent thought leaders in the movement, for example, are concentrated on fighting off artificial intelligence dominance. And some of you may take issue with the potentially oversimplified process aspiring effective altruists employ to determine worthy causes. But it’s harder to argue that causes wouldn’t benefit from more informed citizens making smart use of their limited time and money.

19,87782,"Can Cusco lead the way for other midsized cities? Situated in a fertile valley in the Andes Mountains of Peru, the city of Cusco was once the thriving capital of the Inca Empire. Temples, palaces, schools, roads and a fortress came together to form the city, which many believe was built in the shape of a puma — a sacred animal for the Inca. Today, the city of just over 400,000 inhabitants has become a prime destination for tourists seeking a blend of culture and history. But mixed in with remnants of the city’s Inca and subsequent Spanish colonial past is the noise and congestion of modern life. Cars, trucks and buses have flooded streets originally designed for pedestrians, and traffic police direct the flows of people and automobiles. Since 2000, Cusco has added nearly 40,000 new inhabitants every five years in addition to its annual flow of tourists, and the prevalence of carbon emitting vehicles on crowded city streets has also risen. In Peru, carbon dioxide emissions per capita reached 1.8 metric tons, up 80 percent from 2003, according to the World Bank. The world won’t come close to reaching goals laid out in last year’s historic Paris climate conference without taking cities into account — and midsized cities like Cusco are critically important. A group of 291 rapidly growing midsized, middle-income cities in emerging economies are projected to account for more than one-quarter of global income growth and over one-third of energy-related emissions growth in the next two decades, according to a report from The New Climate Economy. “For a long time, most of the population was going to the larger cities ... But now we are observing a very large growth in midsized cities,” Dario Hidalgo, director of Integrated Transport at the World Resources Institute Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, told Devex. “It’s where urbanization is happening the most.” Midsized cities are the megacities of tomorrow and building sustainable transportation systems in these cities can help to curb their rapid emissions growth. Midsized cities that install clean rail and bus systems and accessible biking and walking paths can set themselves on a more sustainable course and leapfrog the dirty technologies and investments many of the world’s megacities are currently struggling to retrofit. But while it is critically important to build sustainable transportation in midsized cities, it can also be difficult for development professionals and local officials to drive resources and attention to these kinds of projects. Local capacity for change in midsized cities is often in short supply. The brightest minds in urban planning, engineering and sustainable infrastructure often flock to large metropolises with greater opportunities. Another reason is a lack of demand for sustainable transportation projects. Midsized cities tend not to suffer from the outrageous commuting times that plague bigger urban centers, even if they still employ inefficient and environmentally harmful means of transportation. Basic public transit systems that rely on vans or small buses satisfy most people’s needs. The construction of more sophisticated mass transit systems like metros or bus rapid transit feel like low priorities for policymakers with smaller constituencies. It might seem surprising then that in Cusco the world’s largest multilateral donor is working to jumpstart a transportation transformation — one that prioritizes people over automobiles. And transportation experts hope the effort will catalyze action in other midsized cities in the region and around the world. Seeing an opportunity in Cusco The effort in Cusco began as a conversation about a highway. Cusco’s city government was looking for funds from Peru to construct an urban highway to improve the flow of cars. The World Bank, already in dialogue with the country about tourism projects, was pulled into the planning discussion. The World Bank came in to lend its support, but as the bank’s project team leader told Devex, the multilateral institution saw an opportunity to “elevate the discussion” around transportation in midsized cities like Cusco by adding a sustainability component that focused on nonmotorized transport and pedestrians. “[The poor] can’t afford to have a car, but maybe they don’t need it,” said Ramon Munoz-Raskin, a transport specialist at the World Bank and team leader for the Cusco Transport Improvement Project. “We give them sidewalks, we give them pedestrian corridors, we give them the walking environment and the cycling environment so that their mobility approach doesn’t need to be rethought towards cars.” “The mayor fell in love with the concept,” Munoz-Raskin said. The bank approved the $153 million project in early 2014. It includes the development of what Munoz-Raskin described as “an urban boulevard,” with bikeways, public transportation stops and other pedestrian friendly accommodations. It also includes the development of a mobility and public space plan for the city, to identify a pipeline of pedestrian-first mobility projects. “Historically there’s been a neglect to intermediate cities,” Munoz-Raskin said, adding that development organizations and national governments often focus on large cities for their sustainable transportation efforts because in those places they have technocrats to work with. “In this case, we had to build that technical capacity,” the bank official added. The final design of the “urban boulevard” is projected to be completed in 2017 and the mobility and public space plan to be finished this year, supporting a series of mobility projects in the city of Cusco, some of which have already started. Looking beyond Cusco Transportation experts inside and outside the World Bank hope that successful transportation reform in Cusco will provide a valuable case study for government officials around the world at the national and local levels, as well as for development professionals eager to work in midsized cities. A good first step is choosing where to work. When asked what he would do if tasked with jumpstarting a sustainable transportation project in a midsized city in Africa, Munoz-Raskin said he would “ask around to see which cities take pride in being innovative … which cities have mayors that are actually looking forward to partnering, to pursuing ideas that challenge conventional wisdom and that will make their cities more livable and sustainable.” Others appeal for support at the national level. Hidalgo at WRI explained that some national governments, such as Colombia’s, have sustainable mobility policies that include funding and technical assistance pathways to support cities making commitments to sustainable transportation. A supportive national government can help to overcome barriers facing midsized cities, Hidalgo said. Transportation reform in Cusco, if successful, could point towards replicable models for midsized cities. But Cusco also highlights precisely what a unique set of ingredients is needed for success. “The constellation of stars happened, and I think we are very lucky. And when there is an opportunity like this one, we better make very good use of it,” Munoz-Raskin said.

Temples, palaces, schools, roads and a fortress came together to form the city, which many believe was built in the shape of a puma — a sacred animal for the Inca. Today, the city of just over 400,000 inhabitants has become a prime destination for tourists seeking a blend of culture and history. Since 2000, Cusco has added nearly 40,000 new inhabitants every five years in addition to its annual flow of tourists, and the prevalence of carbon emitting vehicles on crowded city streets has also risen. But while it is critically important to build sustainable transportation in midsized cities, it can also be difficult for development professionals and local officials to drive resources and attention to these kinds of projects. And transportation experts hope the effort will catalyze action in other midsized cities in the region and around the world.

20,88517,"How cities are rewiring international affairs If the 20th century belonged to nation states, then the 21st will be owned by cities. There is a certain inevitability about the planet’s urban turn. The past five decades have witnessed a veritable explosion of cities, especially in the developing world. At one end is the rise of supercities, megacities, urban conglomerations of 10 million people or more. On the other is the unheralded, but no less important, swelling of small and medium-sized cities across the globe. Consider the statistics of city growth. Over the past 50 years the number of nation states doubled to reach 193 today. By way of comparison, the number and size of cities with more than 100,000 people increased tenfold over the same period to over 4,000. Today there are 29 megacities and the number should rise to 40 by 2050. And there are another 163 cities with more than 3 million people and at least 538 with 1 million residents or more. Not surprisingly, the geography of power is shifting. The signs of city strength are everywhere. Take the case of Mexico City which fields a total police force of almost 100,000 people, larger than the law enforcement agencies of 115 countries. New York manages an annual budget of roughly $82 billion, bigger than the national budgets of 160 countries around the world. The economic output of metropolitan Seoul — home to half of the South Korean population — is larger than most nation states. A growing number of cities are more populous and powerful than most countries. Beyond driving economic growth Cites are doing much more than power the international economy. It is true that a network of 600 large and intermediate cities, spread out across at least 100 countries, account for two-thirds of global GDP. Compare this to the 10 countries that account for 50 percent of global GDP. But these and other cities are acting as urban laboratories, in some cases designing innovative platforms for democratic deliberation and participation. Some are incubating intelligent solutions to pressing urban dilemmas that transcend borders. When city authorities tap into the ingenuity and know-how of citizens, remarkable ecosystems of innovation emerge. Make no mistake: Urbanization is transforming the face of international relations. Ever since the signing of the Westphalia treaty in 1648, global affairs were driven by the interests of nations. The international system — including its laws and institutions — was purposefully designed by and for national polities. Consider the United Nations — especially its Security Council and General Assembly — designed to maintain peace and stability among its members. International financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were similarly established to help countries integrate into a financial system mediated by international law. After a 300 year hiatus, cities are getting more involved in mediating global relations. This is due in part to the irresistible pressures of urbanization. Cities are to a certain extent resuming functions they once held. Vast city-states such as Chengdu in China and Venice in Italy used to play an outsized role in shaping the terms of trade between societies. Today, as yesterday, cities are forming a new diplomatic corps — with mayors, urban planners, city entrepreneurs, local cultural leaders, academic forerunners and super cops serving as emissaries. Potential for democratic conversation, but lack power Cities offer promising spaces to rethink politics, a counterweight to the dangerous rise of national populism. Cities are spaces where the politics of the everyday are conceived, debated and lived. They are the perfect forum for reflecting on central questions such as equality, justice and the common good. If channels are appropriately fostered, cities offer a real opportunity to renew democratic conversations in a way that national platforms simply cannot. Take the example of the mayors of Barcelona, Madrid and Paris whose ambitious open-doors response to the Syrian refugee crisis dwarfed the tepid policies of their national counterparts. Even so, there are real obstacles to cities assuming a greater role in shaping global affairs. For one, municipal governments are not yet subject to international public law. In diplomatic circles they are still referred to as “sub-” or “infra-” national entities, as if their democratic legitimacy were considered of a “lower” order. “Remarkably, it is still national diplomats, and not mayors, who will set the ""new urban agenda"" to be agreed at Habitat III.” --— Robert Muggah and Eugene Zapata-Garesché At major international conferences — including those dealing with city matters — mayors are asked to sit in the second row (if they are invited at all). There have been some improvements of late, but still with no power to influence in the decision-making process of global affairs. Take the case of the recent U.N.-led informal hearings in the lead-up to the Habitat III conference taking place this October in Quito, Ecuador. The side-event gathered mayors from around the world who addressed a half empty conference room at the U.N. headquarters in New York. There, urban leaders presented their case to a group of second-tier diplomats. The mayor of Quito made an impassioned plea for more opportunities to participate in the global decision making processes of concern to cities. Remarkably, it is still national diplomats, and not mayors, who will set the ""new urban agenda"" to be agreed at Habitat III. In order to increase their international leverage, cities are gathering together in global networks. Federations of cities and mayors such as the United Cities and Local Governments, the World Association of Major Metropolises, the C40 Climate Leadership Group of Cities, and others are pressing for change. Over the past decade there has been an explosion of intercity networking and cooperation across every imaginable topic. All the while, cities are demanding more devolution of power and asserting themselves on the global stage. A new Global Parliament of Mayors, set to launch in September, will give them an unprecedented platform to do precisely this. Cities are forging powerful alliances to improve security and prosperity, often across international borders. For decades, cities nurtured twinning arrangements to promote reconstruction in societies torn asunder by war. Groups such as the Mayors for Peace, Cities for Peace, and the Municipal Alliance for Peace in the Middle East have supported everything from rebuilding broken municipalities to lobbying for nuclear free zones. Alliances are no longer an afterthought, but a central part of doing business. Intercity alliances are the new currency of urban foreign relations. New generation of coalition A promising new form of city activism is shaking the international establishment. Referred to by commentators as “glocalists,” urban diplomats are negotiating intercity agreements, tracking indicators of city livability, canvassing for investment, and committing resources to city counterparts. They understand intuitively that the fragility and resilience of cities requires building strong institutions at home, and positive relations abroad. Many mayors are taking global affairs seriously. They are professionalizing their staff and transforming their international engagements from a light protocol set of activities into fully formed public policy departments. Take the case of Mexico City which in February 2017 will be transformed from a Federal District into an autonomous city. The new metropolis’ magna carta is expected to feature a legal provision that prioritizes the city’s role on the global stage. Other cities are taking note. Cities are no longer just norm-takers, they are norm-makers. A new generation of mayors and city coalitions is emerging busily to ensure that our urban future is embedded in international relations. This is especially important given the inadequacy of the present multilateral system to address major challenges ranging from climate change and migration to governance and security. But if cities are going to build this new layer of global governance they must forge a pact with nation states. This reality can only be achieved in a spirit of collaboration rather than competition. The good news is that many global cities are already moving in this direction. How can cities play a bigger role in setting the new urban agenda in Quito? Leave your comments below.

21,88713,"USAID's top small business contractors for 2015 In fiscal 2015, the U.S. Agency for International Development awarded 18 percent of U.S. transactions to small businesses, exceeding its target of 14 percent, according to the agency. This was the fifth year in a row USAID surpassed its small business utilization target. For the third year in a row, USAID earned at least an A grade on the federal government’s small business scorecard which measures how well federal agencies reach their small business contracting and subcontracting goals. The USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization is responsible for monitoring USAID's implementation and execution of small business programs. OSDBU generally defines a small business as “independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts.” But like other U.S. government agencies, USAID defers to the U.S. Small Business Administration to establish which firms meet the small business classification. In order to make these determinations, SBA sets small business standards by industry and service offering. These standards are typically applied either in terms of the average number of employees a firm claims over the past 12 months or the company’s average annual receipts over the past three years. So for instance, companies offering management consulting services, human resources consulting services, marketing consulting services and logistics consulting services must not exceed $15 million in average annual receipts over the past three years in order to be classified as a small business. A farm equipment and machinery manufacturer, or electronic computer manufacturer on the other hand, must have under 1,250 employees in order for it to register and bid as a small business. While USAID small business procurement targets have been criticized for not being ambitious enough, especially when compared to the 23 percent goal for prime contracting with U.S. small businesses across the federal government, there has been steady improvement in engaging small businesses. In fiscal 2009, USAID received a score of F on the SBA small business scorecard and improved only to a C in 2010. A 2012 audit advised the agency to plug loopholes in federal acquisition regulations that were keeping it from fully utilizing purchases for small business. Since 2009, the overall value of USAID small business contracts have spiked from $90 million to over $343 million. Similar to previous years, the vast majority of small business contracts were procured from Washington and awarded to U.S.-owned and based small businesses. However, USAID reported more mission-based procurements in 2015 with at least five small contractors working in Syria, Afghanistan, Liberia, Somalia, Bangladesh, Kenya and West Africa. Other country missions with significant small business contracting activity include Indonesia, Guatemala, Ukraine, Vietnam and Ethiopia. Based on prime contract obligation data from USAspending.gov, Devex ranks USAID’s top 20 small business contractors worldwide for fiscal 2015.* The top 20 enterprises are all U.S. firms and comprise more than 60 percent of the small business procurement. Camris International Inc. and Dexis Interactive were both awarded over 10 percent of the total funds to small business in fiscal 2015.

22,88884,"The New Urban Agenda vs. the urban planner's dilemma With a final draft of the New Urban Agenda now agreed and ready, the hard part begins. That is, creating the actual policies, partnerships and financing commitments that will put into concrete action the lofty ideals and political visions that tend to comprise high-level intergovernmental documents. One of the main goals of the Habitat III summit that kicks off on Oct. 17 will be to launch that implementation process of the New Urban Agenda. Putting meat on the bones of any U.N. agreement is inherently a tall order. Every word is carefully scrutinized and negotiated for months — perhaps years — to purposely construct a broad-based document that can get consensus approval. The New Urban Agenda is no exception. It sets high ambitions, for instance, of “an urban paradigm shift” that aims to “readdress the way we plan, finance, develop, govern, and manage cities and human settlements.” The tough task of translating that into specifics is not dealt with at the official negotiating table. The onus instead falls on the cadre of mayors, urban planners, property developers, engineers, architects and other municipal officials who work much closer with delivering city services on a day-to-day basis. What exactly does a draft outcome document such as the New Urban Agenda mean to them? And just how difficult is it to turns concepts into action? To get a sense, Devex asked an urban planner. A lot of the answers are more questions — questions about balancing current and future city needs or how to plan anew when city resource currently exist. They reveal the scope of the challenge by highlighting the many pedestrian issues city planners must first address before they can get to the big picture. “Principles are good, but an innovative aspect of urban planning is how to stay true to them when a city is expanding so rapidly?” said Julia Nebrija, an urban planner with the Metro Manila Development Authority, the government agency in charge of urban development for the Philippine capital. “How can planning keep up with that?” The MMDA oversees urban policy for the Metro Manila region, a sprawling megacity of around 12 million people that is made up of 17 smaller cities and municipalities. Crowded, congested and rapidly expanding, Manila is precisely the type of developing country’s city that the goals of sustainable urbanization outlined in the New Urban Agenda were written for. But Nebrija hits on a fundamental challenge that urban planners from many cities similar to Manila face: How can forward planning be properly balanced with the day-to-day management of a growing city? The New Urban Agenda strives to end poverty and hunger in all forms, reduce inequalities and achieve gender equality. But city planners such as Nebrija must first deal with redesigning U-turn slots to keep vehicular traffic flowing or approving construction permits. “The city is changing every day and we’re putting out fires every day. Sometimes we don’t even get to the planning. Just keeping up with the city is difficult,” she said. This type of urban planning dilemma provides important context to the “top-down” approach to city planning advocated by high-level officials. In a recent interview with Devex, Joan Clos, executive director of U.N. Habitat and secretary general of the Habitat III conference, stressed the need for government at all levels to take a more active role in urban planning by guiding sustainable city development with appropriate policies and regulations. For decades, he noted, urbanization was a natural phenomenon that ebbed and flowed with the expansion of industries. But left unchecked it created the kind of congestion and inequalities that the New Urban Agenda aims to address. “We’re losing the main point of urbanization which is that if it’s planned and well designed, it’s a tool for accelerated development,” Clos said. He cited China as an example of a country that developed national strategies based on both urbanization and industrialization. But such a purpose-driven strategy might not always be conducive for sprawling cities that are beyond critical mass. “Can you have a master plan for Metro Manila?” Nebrija asked. “We need a master plan, but it might only work well in a place that is a blank slate.” Urban planning in a city such as Manila, she noted, involves as much untangling current processes and standards as it does strategizing for the future. The day-to-day maintenance and management can make it quite difficult to see the forest through the trees. “There are a million different decisions being made at a million different levels,” Nebrija said. But a high-level concept document such as the New Urban Agenda is not entirely disconnected from the daily grind of an urban planner. An encouraging sign, she said, is that an awareness of the agenda’s broad vision challenges cities such as Manila to rethink the very concepts of efficient urban planning. Municipal planners in the MMDA might not gather around the same table and mull a set of guiding questions around the New Urban Agenda. But they are strategizing how the many fires they put out can be done in ways that promote efficiency and greater inclusivity for city residents. That type of thinking and strategy is currently being applied to address the pressing issue that affects virtually every resident of Metro Manila — traffic. Vehicular traffic and congestion have long stymied the city, but conditions have worsened in recent years to the point of paralysis. “Traffic is a symptom of poor urban planning and a single-sector approach to transportation” she said. MMDA estimates that around 80 percent of Metro Manila residents use mass transit, but 80 percent of the city’s transit infrastructure is taken up by carriageways. “We don’t use our streets well,” Nebrija added. Redesigning streets means reallocating road space, which, in turn, delves into micro-planning exercises. A city bike-share program, for example, is under consideration. But rolling it out requires reconstructing all sidewalks to a uniform height. Or lowering the size of street curbs to prohibit cars from parking alongside them. “We need 1 million moves at that scale,” Nebrija noted. The moves are small, but collectively they coalesce around a broader strategy of repurposing a city’s existing resources so that the solutions provide new and sustainable opportunities. “We are learning as a city what urban planning and development is,” said Nebrija. “A lot of our previous understanding of urban planning has been about a nicely designed central business district.” For now, ways to implement the New Urban Agenda probably raise many more questions than answers. Municipal leaders, planners and the development community will be gathering at Habitat III to brainstorm more practical, actionable solutions. We’ll be on-the-ground at Habitat III so stay tuned for more coverage leading up to the event.

Every word is carefully scrutinized and negotiated for months — perhaps years — to purposely construct a broad-based document that can get consensus approval. The tough task of translating that into specifics is not dealt with at the official negotiating table. But city planners such as Nebrija must first deal with redesigning U-turn slots to keep vehicular traffic flowing or approving construction permits. For decades, he noted, urbanization was a natural phenomenon that ebbed and flowed with the expansion of industries. He cited China as an example of a country that developed national strategies based on both urbanization and industrialization. Nebrija asked. We don’t use our streets well, Nebrija added. Or lowering the size of street curbs to prohibit cars from parking alongside them. We need 1 million moves at that scale, Nebrija noted.","“Principles are good, but an innovative aspect of urban planning is how to stay true to them when a city is expanding so rapidly?” said Julia Nebrija, an urban planner with the Metro Manila Development Authority, the government agency in charge of urban development for the Philippine capital. In a recent interview with Devex, Joan Clos, executive director of U.N. Habitat and secretary general of the Habitat III conference, stressed the need for government at all levels to take a more active role in urban planning by guiding sustainable city development with appropriate policies and regulations. But Nebrija hits on a fundamental challenge that urban planners from many cities similar to Manila face: How can forward planning be properly balanced with the day-to-day management of a growing city? An encouraging sign, she said, is that an awareness of the agenda’s broad vision challenges cities such as Manila to rethink the very concepts of efficient urban planning. The onus instead falls on the cadre of mayors, urban planners, property developers, engineers, architects and other municipal officials who work much closer with delivering city services on a day-to-day basis. “We are learning as a city what urban planning and development is,” said Nebrija. This type of urban planning dilemma provides important context to the “top-down” approach to city planning advocated by high-level officials. MMDA estimates that around 80 percent of Metro Manila residents use mass transit, but 80 percent of the city’s transit infrastructure is taken up by carriageways. Crowded, congested and rapidly expanding, Manila is precisely the type of developing country’s city that the goals of sustainable urbanization outlined in the New Urban Agenda were written for. A lot of the answers are more questions — questions about balancing current and future city needs or how to plan anew when city resource currently exist.",1
23,88942,"What are 'new cities' and why they matter for development To spur economic growth and improve livelihoods, countries often build new industries and infrastructure. Or, in some cases, entirely new cities. Across the “global south,” a crop of megaproject, master-planned cities has been sprouting up as a way for countries to jolt their economies and attract greater foreign investment. It is a striking phenomenon that is currently catching on particularly in developing countries. The trend holds great potential for how urban areas can be planned and designed more efficiently. But so far, most instances of these planned cities still provide a cautionary tale of weak labor standards, environmental degradation and population displacement as countries consider new urban developments. Those were the general findings of a team of urban geographers at McGill University in Montreal which has been studying new cities around the world. They coined the term “new cities” to specifically mean urban areas built on greenfield sites with the purpose of attracting business, investment and new residential areas. The team presented some of their key research findings on this trend at the first day of the Habitat III summit in Quito, Ecuador — the principal United Nations conference on housing and sustainable urbanization. Perhaps the most popularized examples of new city developments today are in the Middle East. The Masdar planned city project in the United Arab Emirates mainstreamed the idea with its futuristic technologies that aimed to achieve zero carbon emissions, though that goal has been significantly dialed back. The King Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia is the largest new city in the world, roughly the size of Washington, D.C. The city actually offers publicly traded shares to fund its operating budget, making its mayor a de facto corporate CEO. In less prosperous parts of the globe hundreds of other new cities are also taking hold. China, India and Malaysia are all constructing new cities. And across sub-Saharan Africa places such as Nova Cidade de Kilambe, Angola; Kakungulu, Uganda; Appolonia, Ghana; and Eko Atlantic, Nigeria are all examples of new cities, according to McGill. The rationale for constructing these new urban areas is pretty clear cut for national governments. Most new cities are driven by foreign private investment that is bullish on the continent’s growth potential in the case of Africa. The foreign direct investment, in turn, can have positive spillovers. It can build state of the art infrastructure, create jobs and target new industries that can diversify economies. Building new cities from scratch gives governments a blank slate to alleviate and address pressing urban problems such as congestion, pollution and sprawl. In principle, new cities can have a huge upside. Builders of new cities have the potential to hardwire cities with features that promote many of the core city services put forward in the New Urban Agenda — the U.N.’s principal framework document for sustainable urbanization. Efficient transport, mobility, walkability and reliable public works are all called upon in the NUA and new state-of-the-art infrastructure in new cities can fulfill those needs. Joan Clos, executive director of U.N. Habitat has also called for cities to undertake smart, fundamental urban planning policies that generate intrinsic wealth and value for citizens. The construction of urban areas predominantly around strategic higher value industries — as is being done with many new cities according to the McGill team — is one way to do that. But in practice, there are several pitfalls in how these new cities in developing countries are currently being executed, the McGill researchers noted. One concern is weak labor standards that can result in construction-related deaths or poor working conditions for laborers. “The creation of world class cities comes at extremely high human costs,” said Sarah Moser, director of the urban studies program at McGill who headed the study. Other areas for potential red flags are environmental degradation and the displacement of people that previously occupied the land. Many instances in China saw the government exercise eminent domain to confiscate land to build new cities, according to McGill research. Further out, as new cities mature, economic sustainability questions also come into play. “How do you manage an artificial city and endow it with the ability to eventually stand on its own two feet and experience organic growth?” Moser said. But the new cities trend is only picking up steam, according to the McGill team. As they continue to expand throughout developing countries, the development community could play a role in monitoring their growth. One immediate priority for the U.N. and other development agencies is to acknowledge new master planned cities as a global trend and set standards for them. Standards could include environmental impact assessments conducted by third parties or “social audits” by independent groups that monitor financial flows for transparency.

24,88981,"Your big NGO isn't a big brand. So what should be your brand strategy? Most people have probably never heard of the world’s largest nongovernmental organization. BRAC, with a workforce of over 100,000 people and projects reaching 1 in every 55 people, is the biggest development organization operating today. But compared with groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam, Red Cross, UNICEF and World Vision, BRAC is hardly a household name. Other organizations have become synonymous with supporting and advocating for developing communities. The difference between BRAC and other international NGOs could be about strategy. Being a brand name doesn’t suit every organization’s needs and may not even be in its benefit. But all NGOs have stakeholders and a message that needs to be communicated to them, so brand does matter. Devex spoke to branding officials and NGO leaders about how organizations decide if popular brand recognition will help their cause. What sort of branding strategy makes sense for big NGOs that aren't and don't want to be household names? Why brand matters The for-profit sector dominates our thinking on branding and so does its aims — creating competitive advantage for a product. “For the not-for-profit sector, the goal is very different. It is to get the mission done,” according to Nathalie Laidler-Kylander, managing director at Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation and author of “The Brand IDEA”. “If you really think the role of the brand is PR and fundraising then you are really missing its power and what it can do for an organization’s mission,” she told Devex. The role of a brand is to help accomplish the organization’s mission. If the average consumer is not a supporter in that mission, it may not make sense for an NGO to be a household brand. Examples include highly focused NGOs with vital but niche operations such as Pratham, which provides education resources to children in India or YWAM Medical Ships, which provide health and medical services to Papua New Guinea via use of a training and medical ship. For organizations that rely on individuals for donations, the calculus is different. “For larger NGOs that depend on fundraising from the general public, it is important to have that household name,” Laidler-Kylander explained. Name recognition and trust can be an important factors when individuals decide whether and to whom they give. “Brands are about making decisions and it helps people to make shortcuts in those decisions.” Building the right brand Laidler-Kylander differentiates two components to branding: The brand identity is the internal description of an organization, anchored in the mission and values, while the brand image is the external perception of the organization. Within an NGO, the person in charge of the brand strategy needs to ensure these two components are aligned. Understanding stakeholders is a critical first step. “Identify stakeholders, key partners, key beneficiaries and really reach out to them to find out how they perceive your work and organization,” Laidler-Kylander urged. This outreach can help identify who the brand should target as well as help ensure stakeholder perception align with the NGOs mission and values. At BRAC, for example, “our focus is, has always been, and will always be, on our work,” Sarah-Jane Saltmarsh, content development manager at the organization, told Devex. That get-things-done attitude has shaped the organization’s visual brand, which has been consistent throughout their history. Their key audiences are the recipients of services, government partner organizations, institutional donors and knowledge partners. “We began as a relief organization, over 40 years ago, as a temporary effort in one village, by one man who believed that poverty was dehumanizing,” Saltmarsh said. BRAC’s visual identity, including a circular logo representing unity, aims to represent them to the world at a glance — bright, natural and honest. Their image focuses on creating a world free of exploitation and discrimination where everyone has the opportunity to realize their potential. After creating a brand concept, NGOs can build brand ambassadors who adequately understand and can target their audience. “Brand ambassadors can be your staff, volunteers; they are definitely your board members, partners that work with you closely and they can also be beneficiaries that have had contact with your services,” Laidler-Kylander said. “Through brand ambassadors you are creating a collective of people that can speak about your work so that you don’t have to.” For household brands, ambassadors are commonly associated with celebrity. But for other brands, an ambassador can be respected figures or expert within fields linked to the NGO with a passion for their cause. They will promote the brand through passion rather than financial incentive. Increasingly, that public diplomacy is happening through social media. “It’s so much easier and much more relevant to have other people speaking about you,” Laidler-Kylander told Devex. “Word of mouth and social media is really critical to building strong brand.” BRAC, for examples, uses a range of platforms to spread their brand message to stakeholders. “We use pretty much everything, from village theatres in the most remote last-mile areas, to interactive digital storytelling,” Saltmarsh explained. A collective brand In addition to advertising the mission and values of NGOs, brands can also be used to create partnerships with other organizations. In this sense, branding within the development community can be just as important as public branding. The NGO RefugePoint offers one example, using their objectives and reputation as a leader in refugee solutions and support to partner with 27 aid and development organizations including the American Refugee Committee, Amnesty International and the U.N. refugee agency. “They use their brand to be conveners and gather up other organizations in their field so that they can start collaborating and reaching out to donors as a united front,” Laidler-Kylander explained. “They are doing it as a collective rather than thinking about brand to create competitive advantage which is very divisive and, longer-term, reduces your ability to implement the mission.” Collaboration has also been a key part of the BRAC brand with partners including the U.K.’s Department for International Development, the U.S. Agency for International Development and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. BRAC has cultivated a reputation for excellence, which has been fundamental in these partnerships. According to a June 2015 report from DfID, BRAC were seen as a “uniquely qualified and credible partner” due their services, capacity, track record and “impeccable credentials”. The risks of high-profile branding A high public profile can be a double-edged sword. If something happens either within the organization or to an organization like them, negative spillover could reduce public trust. “There was a scandal in the U.S. regarding the Red Cross following Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy,” Laidler-Kylander said. “There were allegations that the Red Cross vans were driving around empty so people could see the logo. What happens is if you are just focusing on visibility, you are divorcing the use of your brand from the fundamental mission of your organisation and you create situations that erodes trust.” BRAC increasingly wants to focus on scaling their influence, and the Sustainable Development Goals have provided a platform for their expansion. To achieve the next step in their mission, BRAC will plan to evolve from a respected brand within development to a household development brand. “Right now, we're a household name to 1 in every 55 people, but we definitely want our second stories to reach the other 54,” Saltmarsh said. “We need all 7 billion and counting of us if we are to achieve the BRAC vision.” They will be a brand for all NGOs to watch.

25,89156,"Rachel Kyte on the global energy access challenge The world can’t tackle climate change without also addressing the fact that 1.1 billion people still lack access to energy. Much of the discussion at the Marrakech climate talks has focused on building the energy systems of the future. If those systems are to meet both goals — connecting everyone in the world to energy and also preventing runaway climate change — it will take rigor and discipline to see them realized. Devex spoke with Rachel Kyte, the chief executive and U.N. special representative at Sustainable Energy for All, on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Kyte said she is optimistic climate action and energy access can proceed in tandem. She outlined how to overcome vested interests and pointed out what still gets neglected in the conversation about our global energy future. “We have to throw away all our romantic sense of everybody being equal and everybody’s initiative being wonderful,” Kyte said. Here’s the transcript of our interview, edited for length and clarity: Some people might be tempted to view energy access as antithetical to the goals of climate change emissions reductions. Why are you optimistic that we can both achieve energy access goals and avoid sending emissions levels skyrocketing? If we have an economic proposition for the next few decades — that we’re going to have a cleaner world but the bottom rung of that world are not going to have access to energy — that’s a nonsaleable proposition. It’s deeply unjust, and that’s not what we came to agree last year. In the runup to Paris you heard lots of pontificating that we couldn’t get the 1.1 billion access to energy because it was going to blow emissions through the roof. That’s not true. Even if you gave the 1.1 billion who don’t have access to energy access to coal tomorrow, it’s going to be an infinitesimally small part in global emissions. But coal is not the right answer. A. it’s not the cheapest; and B. it’s deleterious to the health and to the economic well-being of the communities that you would put it in. But we are saved, in some respects, by our current understanding of what’s possible in renewable energy. The prices have plummeted, and that means that for much less money, we can, through different business models, both off-grid and grid-connected, get cleaner energy out to more people. But we are also saved by our understanding of energy efficiency on the demand side, in that we can have a new generation of appliances and devices that use much less energy. So the amount of energy we actually need to get to households and businesses to be productive is less, and that can be done more and more through renewables because they are now the cheapest option and there are new business models emerging. Of all of the [Sustainable Development Goals], this is one that’s doable, affordable, [and] needs to be front-loaded — because we can’t wait until 2030 to have sustainable energy access for everybody. You’re not going to get good quality health care, good quality education if you don’t have access to energy. And if we don’t make a huge step forward in the energy revolution, then the transport revolution, and the manufacturing revolution and the sustainable industrialization which has to happen within this decarbonizing world aren’t going to happen quickly enough either. If this transition isn’t just, then it’s just not sellable at the ballot box the world over. People have to believe that they’re going to be better off in a cleaner world, and people have to believe that the future economy’s going to serve them better than the one of the past. One of the messages of this COP seems to be: the world is moving towards a low-carbon economy. That’s the prevailing trend. Renewables have proven themselves to be commercially viable. I can’t believe it’s the case that you would say we can sit back and let the renewable revolution happen on its own. From your perspective, where are the places where we still need to push back? Where are the remaining sticky issues? We have a reasonable inert energy system with lots of incumbents. For 150 years we’ve been building a centralized energy system, which is powered by fossil fuels. Deconstructing that is not easy. You’re going up against vested interests in terms of where the power’s generated. You’re going up against vested interests in terms of the ministers and institutions that managed all of that. And you’re going up against a generation of people who grew up and were trained to run that kind of system. So, we’re under no illusions that we have to unpick that while we build this new system. The new system is integrated. It’s more distributed, and it’s cleaner. That really is a transition, and that means that you’ve got to get your energy prices right. You’ve got to get rid of the harmful subsidies, you’ve got to work out what you want to subsidize and incentivize, and you've got to run that through parliaments and through governments and all of that. The second thing is energy efficiency. Forty percent of the emissions that need to be reduced can be achieved through energy efficiency. But we’re not doing that. There are large parts of the world where there are huge improvements, and there are large parts of the world where the improvement in energy efficiency is nowhere near on track. If we swapped out the truck fleets and the bus fleet of South Asia and Southeast Asia alone, that would have a huge impact in energy efficiency. If we set the next generation of efficiency standards for vehicles and really, really pushed where we technologically know we can go, we would start to have really big impacts. It’s not happening for a reason — that is that people aren’t focused, it’s dealing with incumbency. It requires political will. It’s not sexy. But that’s where we’ve really got to drive this while the renewables revolution is going on. This is ushering in the era of hard work, sleeves rolled up, deals to be done, standards setting, public policy, all the unfashionable things that have to happen to make things go quicker. Can you say a bit about your role in encouraging this variety of actors to step up and do that? Think about SE4ALL as this massive sandpit, where the public sector and the private sector can come and play and get themselves really focused on what needs to be done. There are certain countries where the public-private dialogue around energy intensity is not as robust as it needs to be. There are conversations, where if we brought different companies from different parts of the world into the debate, it would be really catalytic. There are issues, countries, business models, where conversations are just not happening. First of all, we put the evidence down in front of everybody. We benchmark everybody. And then we try to convene the conversations that aren’t happening, between the actors who are not talking to each other, and support leaders to actually start moving forward. We’re your favorite aunt with elbows. We’re here to nudge everybody to get going and get going quickly … We’re the international energy aunt with elbows. My press people are going to kill me for that. We see how much is going on, but it’s points of light at the moment. The question is how do you connect those points of light so you get speed and scale? … The renewable energy world exists. The energy efficiency world is sort of unloved in another corner, and then the people who are trying to say, “access, access, access.” The three feed off each other, and our job is to constantly show how they all link together. Is there as much excitement about reaching people with energy access as there is about transitioning industry into renewables? Are there parts of this that are getting neglected? Yes and no. Internationally we tend to gravitate towards the three or four renewable energy companies that are doing great things, and we always cite the same five or six deals that are just remarkable, and then we forget all the rest of it. The difficult things — the public policy that is required for those to succeed gets less talked about. Energy efficiency gets less talked about. Clean cooking — always really difficult — gets less talked about. What I’m seeing now is real enthusiasm and innovation at the community and at the business level. For a community that is suffering from high energy prices in the northwest of England, for example, to organize itself to improve the energy efficiency of the social housing, so that they can afford to switch on the electricity that they need to stay warm and to cook, that innovation exists and those things are happening. Communities in the United States that are ill-served by the grid and know that they can get cheaper and more reliable energy by going off grid and just doing it, irrespective of what the utility says and irrespective of what Washington says. This is testament to the fact that this is a global issue and that that innovation exists at the local level. One of the messages that we bring to governments based on the evidence is that if you let the off-grid distributed sector fly, it will solve your problems much more quickly than just going through grid connections. I was just in India where the Indian government has set these remarkably ambitious targets: 2025, everybody has electricity, massive targets for solar, closing the cooking gap in just the next few years. I was out in villages in the Gujarat on the edge of the desert and I was going to village to village, household to household, and these women now have multiple cooking solutions. The government has changed the subsidy from kerosene to LPG … They’re ramping up clean gas cooking, cleaner cooking. These villages are also served by microfinance and support through the self-employed women’s association, so they’ve got eco-stoves, which take much less wood, and then they have their traditional mud stove, and they have their traditional kerosene stove. Now they’ve got all these options, what are they actually doing, because then that informs how you really penetrate that market. So, people use the mud stove to cook the bread, the roti, because it tastes better and they get a better consistency. They use the gas because it’s cheaper and it’s quicker, which frees up their time. They don’t use the kerosene because that’s expensive — it’s no longer subsidized. Maybe they use the eco-stove to complement the gas. You have to understand what those women are choosing to do and why they’re choosing to do it. Once you do, that’s a market of hundreds of millions of women who are going to make new purchasing decisions, new energy purchasing decisions. They’re going to want more devices to be working off the gas. When the grid arrives they’re going to want all kinds of devices to work off the solar grid they’re going to be connected to. This is an extraordinary opportunity, and really understanding how exciting that is, and how sophisticated those who are unserved by energy really are — we tend to think that … they’re poor and therefore we just have to give them a lamp and a cellphone charger. No. These are villages that once they are electrified and once they have clean cooking are going to be starting new businesses. They’re going to be having better health care. They’re going to be having schools with lights on so kids can stay in school longer. The productive demand that is going to be released is extraordinary. And I think that’s the message of business opportunity as well as emissions reductions. It is one of the good news story of a cleaner future. Nothing that’s happened in the last few days changes that. As someone working on energy access, where does your responsibility end? Is it in knowing that that productive capacity you’re talking about has been met — are you following through on the development potential of energy access? Or, does your work stop at achieving access, and then someone else picks it up to see what energy access means for development outcomes? This isn’t about giving everybody a lamp. It’s about creating a market where energy solutions are provided for households and businesses in every part of the world. We’re not going to rest until you can set up a business in a small town in northern Kenya and you can run it knowing that you’ve got reliable, affordable, clean energy for the hours that you need to run that business. That’s going to be critical for sustainable agriculture, because that’s how you’re going to get your solar water pump that allows you to have drop for crop irrigation. It’s all interconnected. I also think it’s going to be the liberation of cities — current and future — because they are going to need to have resilient energy systems, which means they’re going to have a mixture of grid and off grid. It’s going to have to be clean. Otherwise you’re not going to be able to breath in the streets, just as we’ve seen in Delhi and [Los Angeles] and places like that now. I do think this cleaner energy future is a way for everybody to get access to productive levels of energy. But it’s also a way to think about a different way of living for those who already have energy. We have to see this as creative disruption for everybody. It’s not just for those who do not have access to energy. Devex Senior Correspondent Michael Igoe is reporting live from COP22 in Morocco this week.

The second thing is energy efficiency. There are large parts of the world where there are huge improvements, and there are large parts of the world where the improvement in energy efficiency is nowhere near on track. There are certain countries where the public-private dialogue around energy intensity is not as robust as it needs to be. There are issues, countries, business models, where conversations are just not happening. And then we try to convene the conversations that aren’t happening, between the actors who are not talking to each other, and support leaders to actually start moving forward. Energy efficiency gets less talked about. Devex Senior Correspondent Michael Igoe is reporting live from COP22 in Morocco this week. Stay tuned to Devex and follow him @AlterIgoe for on-the-ground coverage.","For a community that is suffering from high energy prices in the northwest of England, for example, to organize itself to improve the energy efficiency of the social housing, so that they can afford to switch on the electricity that they need to stay warm and to cook, that innovation exists and those things are happening. I do think this cleaner energy future is a way for everybody to get access to productive levels of energy. Even if you gave the 1.1 billion who don’t have access to energy access to coal tomorrow, it’s going to be an infinitesimally small part in global emissions. In the runup to Paris you heard lots of pontificating that we couldn’t get the 1.1 billion access to energy because it was going to blow emissions through the roof. If those systems are to meet both goals — connecting everyone in the world to energy and also preventing runaway climate change — it will take rigor and discipline to see them realized. You’re not going to get good quality health care, good quality education if you don’t have access to energy. If we have an economic proposition for the next few decades — that we’re going to have a cleaner world but the bottom rung of that world are not going to have access to energy — The prices have plummeted, and that means that for much less money, we can, through different business models, both off-grid and grid-connected, get cleaner energy out to more people. So the amount of energy we actually need to get to households and businesses to be productive is less, and that can be done more and more through renewables because they are now the cheapest option and there are new business models emerging. Or, does your work stop at achieving access, and then someone else picks it up to see what energy access means for development outcomes?",1
26,89484,"How communities can be involved in monitoring and evaluating development projects Monitoring and evaluating development projects is a task often left to donor agencies and experts. But what would happen if local communities are actively engaged in the process? How can resources be harnessed at a local level for improved results? Devex talked with project managers and experts in the field who gave the following four suggestions. 1. Build community capacity When Laura Hughston, head of program quality and impact at Farm Africa, was at Plan International, she decided to try something new: Hand over control of an evaluation process entirely to children who were beneficiaries of the program. “What was [crucial] to me was that we would train children who were beneficiaries of the project,” Hughston told Devex in an interview. “I didn’t want to have children selected based on their academic talent or background,” she added. So children from underserved communities, some of whom were orphans or school dropouts, were chosen to form the M&E team. “Some had disabilities or other additional challenges,” Hughston said. This strategy was used to monitor projects implemented in three countries — Cambodia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. “In every stage, the children did return a very nuanced assessment that gave us insight on how we can implement projects and include more voices and make sure that what we do addresses everyone’s needs,” Hughston said. Advocates of strategies like Hughston’s believe that overhauling an organization’s monitoring and evaluation processes to engage local communities not only increases transparency, but also empowers community members to make a compelling case for the policies they want. It also benefits those who become part of the process. By building the capacity of a group of young people to collect data from a range of voices with different backgrounds, go through the rigorous process of analyzing the data, and present a compelling case, Hughston considered the experience as a successful development outcome for the children. “Should they choose in future to use that to advocate for their rights and put forward a compelling case for what they need, they have the skills to do that themselves,” she said. Hughston applies the same participatory monitoring in her current role as head of monitoring and evaluation at Farm Africa, a nonprofit that provide technical support for farmers in East Africa. “The feedback from the community helps us understand the consequences of our projects, how we are doing it and how we can do it better,” she said. It is more about getting a plurality of voices rather than getting one or two people to say, “this is working for me,” Hughston believes. 2. Make beneficiaries the center of programming from the beginning Communities should be empowered to not only evaluate but also to monitor projects right from their implementation, said Diana Nsubuga, the Uganda country manager for the Global Health Corps. “The NGOs should just come in to support with either the technical skills or tools. But the community should be a major stakeholder in measuring impact and monitoring evaluation,” she said. For example, Global Health Corps gathers feedback about the impact of its fellowship from the fellows who participate in the program, instead of relying on only the evaluation provided by the host organizations where these fellows work. This way, the fellows remain at the center of the programming. “Those we call beneficiaries should be allowed to decide what success should look like and the metrics to assess it,” said Hughston. “Local people's metrics of success should count, not just the metrics of donors and agencies.” 3. It does not replace traditional M&E World Neighbors, an international nonprofit working with underserved communities to improve livelihoods, is another example of an NGO that engages communities in the assessment and evaluation of projects. Their long-term approach to project implementation requires them to stay between eight and 10 years in the communities where they work. This allows the project managers to collaborate with the beneficiaries to implement a five-stage development model of project initiation, growth, expansion, consolidation and maturity. “We are not a one sector development organization,” said Kate Schecter, World Neighbor’s CEO. “That is why it takes us a decade to go through all these different stages and to address all of the various needs of the community.” World Neighbors will not go into a community with the intention of helping provide a solution to a problem without first assessing the situation, Schecter said. She explained that the team moved from using a needs-based assessment to asset-based assessment approach in addressing community issues. This means that instead of looking at what the community doesn’t have, World Neighbors project managers look at what the community has and work with them to figure out how they can lift themselves out of poverty by enhancing the work. “When we do the asset-based evaluation, the community is involved at every stage,” Schecter said. However, this does not take the place of the traditional mechanism used for monitoring and evaluation, or the metrics required by donors. World Neighbors still sends quarterly reports to field offices. “We have meetings every year to develop work plans with our partners,” said Schecter. The expanded evaluation helps identify trouble spots and ways to overcome them. “We also have external evaluation going on either because a grant requires it or we want to make sure that we are on track,” she said. 4. Continuing community ownership is key Although some nongovernmental organizations already engage communities in monitoring and evaluation, many still underestimate the value of such engagement. As a result, when the project ends, the community is not able to take ownership to ensure sustainability. A simplified process that does not need complicated technical know-how can be created for these communities to continue to assess and monitor projects even after an NGO’s exit. Takah Kapikinyu — an M&E technical manager for an international nonprofit organization based in Virginia — gave an example of how he has seen this approach work. The process of monitoring and evaluation could involve recruiting members of the communities to form a committee that helps gather data during a project, he said. By engaging the community members in the process of data collection, they gain a better understanding of why they need to collect the data and why the data is important. They also learn to use the data to lobby the local government legislature to address the issues identified during the process of gathering the information. “If you have a basic system that allows the people to collect data, analyze data at the community level and use these data, I think it is important,” Kapikinyu said. He did, however, point out the need for emphasis to be placed on outcomes of a project and not outputs because output focuses on the number of people changed but the outcome is what change has been achieved. ""Local communities are often consulted on projects but rarely are they asked to evaluate the results,"" Hughston said. Focusing on the outcomes will improve the way that development community share information with the community. “In order for the community to be fully engaged and for communities to support our efforts in M&E, we need to address that feedback loop,” Kapikinyu said. NGOs should also come back to the community and interpret the outcome at the community level,” he said.

27,89738,"Lessons for building an eco-city from scratch CASABLANCA, Morocco — Building an eco-city from scratch is a balancing act. Developers at Morocco’s Zenata kept environmental impact and job creation in mind as they set about to design their urban strategy. Their goal was a sustainable urban development project that optimized natural resource use. At each step, they evaluated their performance according to key social, environmental, and economic performance indicators. Devex saw the results first hand during a visit to Zenata Eco-City last month. A mixed sewage collection system, for example, redirects rainwater toward retention ponds. The design also reserved 30 percent of the land for green spaces to promote biodiversity. With the eventual opening of an integrated health care center, university campus and shopping center, Zenata expects to offer 100,000 jobs to its estimated 300,000 residents, according to Mohamed Naciri, business development director at Zenata Development Company — the group responsible for the city’s design. Zenata’s phase one broke ground in 2012, and to date, all major roads have been built, an IKEA retail store has opened at the retail center, and the foundation for a residential area has been laid in the 2,000 acre area. Developers say the city’s neighborhood, Quartier de la Ferme, should be welcoming families by 2020. The city’s systemic approach was recognized by French HQE certification agency Cerway for its sustainable standards, as well as its inclusion of national and local issues. The project was awarded an “eco-city label” in October 2015 and now serves as a blueprint for similar urban projects in Africa and abroad. Experts at the Zenata Development Company spoke with Devex about their takeaways from the planning and implementation phases of the project. 1. Build strong partnerships at local, national and international level The biggest challenge for Zenata’s developers was managing their vast network of partners and stakeholders, Naciri said. “You’re talking about state, civil, local authorities, civil society, financial institutions, investors, private companies … It’s a lot,” he said. He found that prioritizing inclusion and communication was essential. Producing tangible results can help. Building an eco-city can take 30 to 40 years. As Zenata started to become a reality, Naciri said he found it easier to help partners and the population understand and believe in the project. “You have to gain the confidence of all these parties, and once you have their confidence that’s your real starting point.” 2. Consider location Zenata is strategically located roughly a half-hour drive from Casablanca to the south and an hour’s drive from Rabat to the north and will serve a hub for road, rail and sea transport infrastructure. That sort of positioning is vital to ensure that a new city can take some of the pressure off other urban areas. New cities need to be accessible and convenient for businesses and residents to embrace them. “Location is crucial in developing a sustainable project because with a good location you will maximize the potential of your objectives,” said Director of Sustainable Development at Zenata Mustapha Chafik. Zenata, for example, sits along the Atlantic Ocean, opening possibilities for future import-export trade. Zenata Development Company is working to turn that potential into reality. Company officials sought local government permission to demolish temporary housing that currently exists along the coastline. They then plan to build a road directly from the Zenata’s industrial zone to the ocean, which Chafik said could serve retailers that receive international shipments or as a new port of trade for national companies. 3. Think about jobs Job creation was a high priority for developers working on Zenata, they told Devex. The city incorporated a range of employment opportunities into its development plan by including a shopping mall, university, health care center and industrial park. The city has a capacity of 300,000 residents with a plan to provide one-third with work. Naciri expects businesses will also increasingly look to set up shop in Zenata, rather than in Casablanca or Rabat, its two neighboring cities. Naciri hopes Zenata can serve as a model for others interested in building an eco-city. The context may vary, but he told Devex that future cities can emerge in a way that considers local solutions for social, environmental and economic challenges. “Copying Zenata will not work for every situation. Instead, Zenata offers an approach where you look at three major pillars at the same time throughout the development process to make sure you’re not forgetting anything or anyone along the way.” Editor’s note: The Agence Française de Développement facilitated Devex's travel and logistics for this reporting.

29,90033,"Water Supply and Sanitation: Where the aid flows Water supply and sanitation marked both a highlight and a missed opportunity under the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). MDG 7 on ensuring environmental sustainability particularly targeted to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015. While the world was able to reach and slightly surpass the water target, it fell short of the sanitation target. Latest estimates of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation for 2015 show that 90% of the world’s population now has access to improved sources of drinking water, which still leaves at least 650 million people lacking dependable access to clean water. Meanwhile, one in three people or about 2.4 billion still lack access to improved sanitation worldwide. Among those were 946 million people, who without any facilities, continued to practice open defecation. Highlighting water supply and sanitation as a global priority, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the successors of the MDGs, include a dedicated water and sanitation goal (SDG 6), which not only tackles drinking water, sanitation and hygiene issues, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources. In particular, SDG 6 sets out to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” by 2030. External Assistance to the Sector Significantly Increased Over the Past Decade In 2015—the latest year for which official development assistance (ODA) figures are available from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development—assistance to water supply and sanitation was at $6.6 billion. While the figure was lower than 2014’s record high of $7.3 billion for the 10-year period beginning 2006, it marked a growth of more than two-thirds from 2006’s $3.9 billion. India was the top recipient for the decade ending in 2015, taking in $3.2 billion with Japan, the World Bank, and the UK as its top donors. Following India was Vietnam ($3 billion) that had the World Bank, Japan and ADB as top donors. Third was China ($2.4 billion) that had Germany, Japan and the ADB as top donors. Traditional donors to water supply and sanitation comprised the top 10 givers of external assistance to the sector in 2015. Traditionally the largest donor to water supply and sanitation, Japan expectedly topped the list of donors in 2015, spending almost $1.2 billion or around 18% of the total disbursed funds for the sector that year. Japan devoted around $12.9 billion, representing 22% of total disbursements to the sector in the previous 10 years beginning 2006. One of the thematic issues of work under the Japan International Cooperation Agency, assistance relating to water resources is expected to remain a prominent feature in Japan’s ODA in the coming years. India has consistently been the top recipient of Japanese ODA to the sector since 2010, receiving an average of $281 million of disbursed funds per year. Japan, the World Bank, and Germany and the EU were consistently the top four donors to the sector from 2009 to 2015. Other top donors to the sector in 2015 include France, the US, ADB, AfDB, the UK and Switzerland. Among world regions, sub-Saharan Africa received most funding for the sector in 2015, obtaining almost $2 billion. The region was followed by South & Central Asia ($1.1 billion), Far East Asia ($848 million), the Middle East ($717 million), and North of Sahara ($542 million). According to the joint WHO and UNICEF’s figures for 2015, half of the total population who do not have access to drinking water from improved sources can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa at 319 million, while Southern Asia accounted for 20% of the total with 134 million people. It was noted that 70% of the 159 million people relying on water taken directly from rivers, lakes and other surface waters live in sub-Saharan Africa, with only 5% of the rural population and 43% of urban dwellers getting piped-water to the household. In terms of access to improved sanitation, a significantly majority or 64% in Southern Asia continue to practice open defecation, compared with 33% in sub-Saharan Africa. Who Needs Water and Sanitation Aid? Interestingly, the top recipient countries for water supply and sanitation ODA are not necessarily the countries most in need of the assistance. Vietnam, the highest recipient of disbursed aid flows to the water supply and sanitation sector, received $387 million in 2015, but is not as troubled by water stress or water scarcity compared to other countries. In fact, the WHO has cited the country, which exceeded the MDG target on water and sanitation, as being closer to bringing universal access. The WHO said that as of 2015, 98% of Vietnam’s more than 90 million residents have access to improved drinking water sources and 78% of the population uses toilets and latrines that meet international standards. Vietnam is the preferred recipient country of top donors to water and sanitation, particularly Japan, the World Bank and the ADB. Aside from Vietnam, countries receiving aid from top donors include India, Jordan and Nigeria whose benefactors are Japan, the World Bank, Germany, France, the US, ADB, and AfDB. Incidentally, among the top 10 countries receiving ODA for the sector, only one—Ethiopia—was a low income economy. Five—Vietnam, Morocco, India, Bangladesh and Nigeria—were lower middle income economies, whereas the remaining four—Jordan, China, Iraq and Turkey—were upper middle income economies. The UN has pointed out that numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year). Further underscoring the need to improve methods to identify target countries and track global aid for water and sanitation is the effect of China and India on global water and sanitation trends. Global progress and efforts towards meeting the SDG 6 are heavily influenced by two of the world’s most populous countries. The latest edition of the UN World Water Development Report, ‘Wastewater: The Untapped Resource.’ stated that two-thirds of the world’s population currently live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year. Noteworthy is that about 50% of the people facing this level of water scarcity live in China and India. The rate of change in these two countries therefore tends to directly impact global water and sanitation trends, although this may not necessarily be representative of the situation in majority of the countries. Smarter Investments According to UNESCO, investments in water and sanitation services result in substantial economic gains. In developing regions, the return is estimated at $5 to $28 per dollar. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030, however, requires investments in adequate infrastructure, sanitation facilities, and hygiene training. Environmental protection, especially of water-related ecosystems, is equally essential to help address water scarcity. And, with 79% of the people using unimproved sources and 93% of people using surface water living in rural areas, stronger initiatives of donor countries towards narrowing the rural-urban gap regarding access to drinking water have become even more apparent. In line with the SDG 6 targets, donor countries are further encouraged to fund programs focusing on improving not just access to water, but also towards improving water quality for all.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Meanwhile, one in three people or about 2.4 billion still lack access to improved sanitation worldwide. In particular, SDG 6 sets out to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Following India was Vietnam ($3 billion) that had the World Bank, Japan and ADB as top donors. Traditionally the largest donor to water supply and sanitation, Japan expectedly topped the list of donors in 2015, spending almost $1.2 billion or around 18% of the total disbursed funds for the sector that year. Japan, the World Bank, and Germany and the EU were consistently the top four donors to the sector from 2009 to 2015. According to the joint WHO and UNICEF’s figures for 2015, half of the total population who do not have access to drinking water from improved sources can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa at 319 million, while Southern Asia accounted for 20% of the total with 134 million people.

Latest estimates of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation for 2015 show that 90% of the world’s population now has access to improved sources of drinking water, which still leaves at least 650 million people lacking dependable access to clean water. Highlighting water supply and sanitation as a global priority, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the successors of the MDGs, include a dedicated water and sanitation goal (SDG 6), which not only tackles drinking water, sanitation and hygiene issues, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources. In line with the SDG 6 targets, donor countries are further encouraged to fund programs focusing on improving not just access to water, but also towards improving water quality for all.

31,90388,"How to include a randomized controlled trial in your project proposal Randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, can be an effective way of determining the true impact of interventions. It is a scientific approach to information gathering that includes a group receiving an intervention and a control group that does not. Randomization within the trial means there is minimal bias in the selection of participants, to allow true insights to be generated. For development projects, they are not always a viable option. But when they are, they need to be carefully planned and prepared to ensure they can provide high quality results that effectively communicate why an intervention does or doesn't work — improving aid and development programs for the future. The value of RCTs Dr Tessa Hillgrove, a senior research adviser with The Fred Hollows Foundation, explained to Devex that in knowing “what works” in development practice, there are a range of sources of evidence that can be used. As part of this, RCTs are considered the highest form of evidence — the “gold standard” of understanding what works in development practice. “By using random assignment methods for individuals or clusters of organizations or people by geographical location — more commonly in development research — RCTs allow us to say whether a particular program really makes a difference,” she explained. “For example, does [mobile] health technology encourage more patients to seek follow-up care after surgery, or would they have sought care anyway? Does a special curriculum improve learning outcomes for children above and beyond standard practice?” But Hillgrove explained that their use is not always practical. “RCTs take considerable time, money, and expertise to do well, and that level of investment isn’t warranted for every project,” she said. “Additionally, RCTs require standardized implementation of project activities in different or randomly selected areas, with pre-defined timelines, which can limit their use for real-world settings.” How they are used should then be considered on a case-by-case basis where the circumstances allow. What to think about when considering RCTs Hillgrove’s advice is for organizations to first consider the purpose for wanting to undertake an RCT, including the evidence that is required from this evaluation and its use. The investment of effort in an RCT must be warranted and high quality evidence should be the desired output. Financial and human resources support must also be available. “It takes considerable resources, and expertise, to undertake high-quality research,” Hillgrove explained. “RCTs of development programs are usually conducted through a partnership between a development agency and Australian or local research institute, however it’s important that there’s internal staff with the technical capacity and time to manage the research relationship.” Seeking advice at an early stage to make sure the right support is available is an important step in considering the use of RCTs. Realistic timelines also need to be set to allow for effective RCTs and high-quality results for evaluation. “Good research takes time in setting up the partnerships, designing the protocol and tools, seeking ethical approval, conducting the research, analysis and dissemination,” Hillgrove said. “It’s likely to be a multi-year commitment.” Alternative options should be considered before going down the path of considering RCTs. “The cost [of RCTs] can be high — usually higher than the standard 5 to 10 percent of budget allocated to project evaluation — so it is a trade-off between what’s needed from the evaluation and what time and resources are available,” Hillgrove said. “Seek expertise if you’re not sure on the evaluation approach to take.” Challenges for RCTs in the development sector RCTs are not right for every program or intervention — not just in the development setting, but any research project requiring evaluation. Untargeted projects, such as mass-media awareness raising campaigns or policy changes are certainly projects that do not need to invest in RCTs. Operational contexts should also be avoided for RCTs. “In an operational research context, programs often change during implementation,” Hillgrove said. “This is normal and entirely appropriate in response to lessons from formative evaluation activities, but has implications for the quality of the RCT.” The controlled environment setting required for quality RCT results is not something commonly implemented in development projects. Additionally, the change sought through development projects often takes more time than can be achieved within the RCT timeframes. Observational studies, as opposed to experimental design, are more appropriate in development research according to Hillgrove. Lessons from on-the-ground implementations of RCTs Dr Mike Nunn, research program manager of animal health with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, explained to Devex the complexity of the use of RCTs in a development setting. Nunn oversees research programs in a range of countries that support smallholder farmers to refine livestock management practices, creating healthier stock for improved production and income-generation. Nutrition is linked to this research, which seeks to understand how improved animal handling and health can lead to improved childhood health. One of the programs overseen by Nunn utilized RCTs to investigate changing animal handling practices on the quality of milk. A control village, in which the intervention did not occur, was nearby. Initial results suggested the health of children in the village with the new practice were improving. It was a positive sign for the research. But in establishing the RCT, the researchers underestimated the ability for word to spread between communities. Soon, the new practice was also seen in the control village. Parents wanted what was best for their children and trial or no trial, they were going to implement a practice that would improve health and opportunities. Embedding RCTs into project proposals The key in understanding whether RCTs are relevant to a project is to seek expert advice early in the project proposal stage. “RCTs are very important, but they are not the be all and end all,” Hillgrove advises. “There’s a lot that can be learnt from other study designs.” If RCTs are deemed critical to the intelligence and reporting requirements of the development project, realistic budgets and timelines need to be included in the proposal. Internal capacity within the organization needs to also be planned as part of the project proposal, to support both the research partnership and implementation of the study on the ground. And throughout the project, inception and ongoing meetings should ensure all direct and indirect stakeholders in the project are on the same page. “Research institutes may not [be] aware of the amount of effort project and country office staff have to put into facilitating research activities,” Hillgrove said. The result will be a planned and effective RCT that delivers important insights and intelligence on the effectiveness of development interventions.

In an interview with Devex at the European Development Days summit in Brussels, Mimica — the Croatian politician who has led development policy at the European Union since 2014 — said that monitoring, reviewing and accountability have “maybe been a bit neglected in the first few years or stages of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals ... because we and all the international community were very much engaged in setting the right agenda and setting the implementation modalities of this agenda.” He added that accountability is an important element of those modalities and that “we shall be very clear and very much engaged in this” from now on. Mimica insisted that the EU already has “very much in place the criteria and the methodology that prevents a misuse of development assistance.” He suggested that development cooperation programs typically perform better in the EU’s annual reviews than programs implemented internally within the European Union. “The average error rate [where procedures have been followed incorrectly] is around 2 percent of our development envelopes,” he said. “But this is not satisfactory enough yet. Therefore, we shall work further on setting the right criteria in advance for disbursement of our projects; and criteria that are to be checked once the ... projects are disbursed.” “Current criteria are there, but we have to really upgrade the overall focus of our services on this element of the implementation process of our development projects,” he added. The EU’s new Consensus on Development — a development framework that was signed into force this week — is controversial among NGOs, in part because of its renewed emphasis on the role of the private sector in aid and on tackling migration. In both cases, some European NGOs believe there are insufficient safeguards in place to ensure the proper use of funds. However, Mimica told Devex that there would be a greater focus on accountability under the new framework. “Within the new agenda we make a shift from inputs to outputs; from counting money we put into the development cooperation to reviewing the results of development cooperation in each and every partner country.

34,90473,"DevExplains: How WHO's incident management system works Following the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organization restructured the way it works in outbreaks and emergencies.

35,90617,"Opinion: Bringing nutrition in from the cold Today, at least 1 in 3 people on the planet are consuming nutritionally poor diets. A poor diet is a driver of malnutrition in all its forms: From undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies to overweight and obesity. Six out of the top 11 risk factors in the global burden of disease are related to poor diet. Working with partners, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition believes making healthier food choices more affordable, more accessible, and more desirable is critical to tackling this problem. Celebrating our 15th birthday in 2017, GAIN has significant experience in tackling malnutrition, and these are some of the lessons we’ve learned along the way that are shaping our next steps. 1. Alliances are key. Malnutrition is caused by a number of powerful forces that work together, seemingly in concert, and overcoming it requires strong stakeholder partnerships to coalesce and work together. GAIN puts this into practice with initiatives such as the Scaling Up Nutrition Business Network, which we co-convene with the World Food Programme, the Global Fortification Data Exchange, and countless other global and national alliances. Alliances are core to solutions. 2. Private sector needs to be in the conversation. From the outset, GAIN was bold enough to identify that the private sector may be a part of the problem, but it also has to be part of the solution to malnutrition. This is a far less controversial thing to say today. Speaking at our Geneva birthday party, David Nabarro, who was present at GAIN’s creation, reminded us of how so many at the time were opposed to setting up GAIN, or to any initiative that sought to engage business in tackling malnutrition. The Sustainable Development Goals, the Scaling Up Nutrition movement, and the United Nations' Decade of Action on Nutrition all recognize the potential positive contributions that responsible businesses can make to improve nutrition. But 10-15 years ago, unfamiliarity bred fear and distrust. As different stakeholders work together more frequently, trust is built up between those that earn it with reputations, good and bad, established through repeated interactions. Making markets work for nutrition is here to stay. 3. The nutrition world needs to be in the food system. GAIN helped bring the nutrition world into the food system, perhaps not in a way that was so cognisant of the need to change the food system, but knowing that one had to work up and down it if large scale food fortification was to have a positive impact on nutrition. The world — and our own nutrition sector — is now waking up to the undeniable fact that while food systems need to be guided by government-led public health goals, they are actually powered by private sector investment and entrepreneurs from “farm to fork,” micro, small, medium, and large. It is not just agriculture that needs to become more nutrition sensitive, it is food trade, storage, transport, processing, marketing, retailing, and advertising too. This food systems approach has to become the new normal to guide program work. “These challenges only seem difficult because we have not applied enough imagination, problem solving, resources and grit towards resolving them.” --— Lawrence Haddad, executive director, GAIN This system approach is designed to help GAIN have impact at scale. Take Universal Salt Iodization — we work with governments and producers to develop and implement salt iodization programs, working with producers, processors, regulators, and consumers. It takes an investment of just $25 to protect at least 100 people with a lifetime of adequately iodized salt, improving health and protecting against iodine deficiency disorders such as debilitating brain damage. Since 2008, our USI program in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund has supported 17 countries across Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, and Tajikistan. In this time we helped to protect an additional 466 million people in 17 Asian and African countries against iodine deficiency. This includes an estimated 18.2 million pregnant and lactating women, leading to the protection of newborn cognitive health, as well as 113 million children aged six months to 15 years old who are no longer at risk of the debilitating effects of iodine deficiency. We continue to raise resources for USI in the 19 countries that remain iodine deficient today. Of course, some people may say USI is an easy thing to do if you want to have impact at scale. We would argue that it may seem easy now — it isn’t — but it seemed a lot harder back in the 1980s and 1990s. It is the hard work over decades by many stakeholders working together that has made salt iodization the norm, at least outside of the 19 countries where USI has still to break through. In fact, it is striking how many food related things in the second decade of the 21st century seem so difficult to achieve: Finding ways of engaging adolescents to shift their diets towards healthier food choices; managing rapidly urbanizing food systems so that they make nutritious food cheaper and more desirable; supporting companies small, medium, and even large that want to make a strong business case out of delivering nutritious foods to consumers; and creating functioning cold chains in low-income settings so that the most nutritious food does not rot in the field, in storage, or in transit carts. These challenges only seem difficult because we have not applied enough imagination, problem solving, resources, and grit towards resolving them. We must not be complacent. In 15 years we have seen some real achievements — reductions in global stunting for example — but also some menacing new trends in global overweight and obesity rates, and even last year a rise in the number of hungry people. But it does feel as if we are at last moving the agenda to addressing the core problem of how to build a food system that engenders healthy and nourishing diets for all. Nutrition has come in from the cold. GAIN at 15 is now in full-blown adolescence in the sense that we are constantly balancing the risk-taking experimentation necessary to achieve food system breakthroughs in thinking and action with the more systematic planning and logic needed to actually realize those creative ideas. Our aim, working with our partners, is to blend these two precious skills so that when people in 2030 look back at the seemingly intractable food and nutrition problems of 2017 they will wonder “Why did people think that was so difficult back then?” For more information on GAIN’s work and to join the endeavor as they tackle malnutrition, click here.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A poor diet is a driver of malnutrition in all its forms: From undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies to overweight and obesity.

36,90882,"Communication, access surface as top challenges in Nepal flood response BANGKOK — The rain has finally slowed, but the work is just beginning for humanitarian actors responding to what is being called “Nepal’s worst rainfall in 15 years” by the country’s United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator. Reports are beginning to trickle in from across southern Nepal on just how much damage the past week’s monsoon rains have done. Incessant rain has triggered widespread flooding and landslides in 27 of the country's 75 districts, killing an estimated 115 people, wiping out homes, crops and stored grains and sweeping away livestock. Clean drinking water is scarce, and the threat of waterborne illnesses high. Search and rescues are underway in all 27 districts, and Nepal’s Ministry of Home Affairs authorities estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been affected, though the exact number of people in need of assistance remains unknown. The population of the flood-hit districts totals approximately 11.5 million people. “The flooding has affected a much larger area of land [than the 2015 earthquake], with crops wiped out in so many places in the country’s rice bowl and bread basket — the most important food-producing region.” --— Neena Joshi, spokeswoman for Heifer International There are still more questions than answers for humanitarian actors on the ground, many of whom were able to begin delivering aid — mainly dry food items, water and tarpaulins — to communities in need of assistance on Tuesday, as water receded in the east. Still, flooded roads and continuous rain through Wednesday in the west have made transport a major obstacle, while drowned telecommunication towers and lines are testing teams’ communication abilities. Shreeram KC, communications manager for Plan International Nepal, cited transportation as the biggest challenge to the INGO’s current response in the country. In Rautahat district, the Plan emergency response team on Tuesday focused on delivering food items to 250 families in some of the most marginalized communities of the district — at high risk for sudden and severe impact on malnutrition rates. The main highway to reach the identified area has been flooded at least 100 meters across, KC described, with many people having to stop at a point on one side, take a boat across the floodwater and organize separate transport on the other end. Once in the vicinity, Plan is relying mainly on motorbikes and local tractors to help deliver supplies in areas dry enough to drive. Adding to the challenge is that “the communities we are trying to assist are very scattered,” KC said. “As the week continues we are thinking to have more motorbikes and local tractors to carry the goods to the distribution points.” Many community members are seeking shelter in schools, or creating crowded makeshift floating villages out of boats. Community leaders who might have relied on a mobile phone to call for assistance in these cases aren’t able to do so, due to lack of charging power. Collapsed telecom towers in some districts, meanwhile, are making coordination a challenge among NGO staff members as well, according to Durga KC, associate director of programs for nonprofit Heifer International Nepal, which works with smallholder farmers throughout the country. KC is currently managing a 15-member relief operation in the mid-western part of the country, focused on assistance in Sunsari, Morang, Rautahat, Banke and Bardiya. To make up for lack of mobile communication during the day, “in the evening, no matter where we’ve gone that day, we come together and sit together to review what we’ve accomplished and make a plan for the next day,” Heifer’s KC said. Nepal Red Cross Society has mobilized 500 people on the ground to assist local government authorities to conduct rapid needs assessments and to paint a more comprehensive picture of damages. Right now, the most immediate needs are food, water, medicine and animal feed, as well as blankets and tarps, according to Dibya Raj Poudel, Nepal Red Cross Society head of communications. This emergency comes at a time when Nepal is still struggling to recover from the 2015 earthquake; five of the current flood affected districts are also earthquake affected districts, and four of the current flooded districts had yet to fully recover from large-scale flooding in 2014. “We are feeling pressure to give support to many areas,” Poudel said, “perhaps beyond our capacity.” Though immediate needs are topping to-do lists, many humanitarians are already looking ahead at long-term effects, namely on agriculture, food security and nutrition. The flooding can’t compare to the devastating 2015 earthquake if considering casualties alone, said Neena Joshi, a spokeswoman for Heifer International in Nepal, “but the flooding has affected a much larger area of land, with crops wiped out in so many places in the country’s rice bowl and bread basket — the most important food-producing region.” With so many livelihoods hanging in the balance, it will be crucial to take as swift and as effective action as possible, said Poudel, who estimates that the Red Cross, together with the Nepal government, will complete the initial rapid assessments this week. “This is a time of emergency response,” he said. “From next week, we can manage properly and know what to support, where to support and how to support.” Read more international development news online, and subscribe to The Development Newswire to receive the latest from the world’s leading donors and decision-makers — emailed to you free every business day.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Incessant rain has triggered widespread flooding and landslides in 27 of the country's 75 districts, killing an estimated 115 people, wiping out homes, crops and stored grains and sweeping away livestock.

37,90918,"5 topics to watch at Stockholm World Water Week WASHINGTON — Wastewater, and how to reduce it, clean it and recycle it, is the theme of this year’s World Water Week conference in Sweden next week. The theme seems especially appropriate as a record number of countries around the world grapple with devastating droughts while seeking to meet the increasing water demands of the world’s growing population. Thousands of delegates from civil society, government, academia and the private sector are set to gather in Stockholm for the week-long event, which is the largest and longest-running annual conference — now in its 27th year — in the water calendar. But this year’s conference — organized by the Stockholm International Water Institute — aims to broaden out beyond its traditional realm of water use, sanitation and hygiene, attracting participants from across the development sector — including actors in health, agriculture and energy — and outside of it, including private sector players such as businesses, insurers, financiers and manufacturers. This is linked to what SIWI’s Executive Director Torgny Holmgren describes as the need to see water as a “resource” and a “scarce commodity” that is fundamental to a wide community of actors. “Water is in high demand … we will need up to 55 percent more water by 2050 to feed our industrial, energy and food production needs,” he said. ”And we need to become more smart and efficient in the way we handle this scarce resource.” The importance of ensuring equitable access to clean drinking water and sanitation for the world’s poor remains — the U.N estimates that 2.1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water, and 4.5 billion to sanitation services — but Holmgren is calling for a more joined-up approach to solving the multiple dimensions of the water problem. “My vision is that we should look at water in a coherent way, thinking not only about water use but also water as a resource,” he said. “Looking at the Sustainable Development Goals, nearly every one of them needs water, and so instead of this traditional siloed thinking, let’s look more synergistically.” This will mean reducing the amount produced as wastewater and finding better means of recycling it, Holmgren said, explaining the rationale behind the theme of this year’s conference: “water and waste: reduce and reuse.” This is also the theme of the most recent U.N. World Water Development Report, released in March, which makes the case that better and more treatment of wastewater could be crucial in addressing the world’s looming water shortage. According to the report, more than 80 percent of the world’s wastewater produced by domestic, agricultural and industrial activities is released directly into rivers, lakes and seas without being treated, which can lead to waterborne diseases and environmental damage. In low-income countries, the figure stands at more than 95 percent. Participants can therefore expect that a good number of the more than 200 sessions — which range from high-level panels to more informal seminars and workshops — will address the issue of wastewater, which is specifically mentioned in Goals 6 and 12 of the Sustainable Development Agenda. Organizers said they expect this year’s attendance to be bigger than ever, with approximately 3,300 participants from civil society, government, the private sector and academia attending across the week, which runs from Aug. 27 through Sept. 1. But discussions will extend far beyond wastewater. Devex will be reporting from Stockholm next week. Here are five topics to watch out for. 1. Climate change and green infrastructure The impact that rising global temperatures are having on water is one of the most visible ways in which the world is experiencing the effects of climate change, especially in developing countries. East and Southern Africa, parts of the Middle East, Australia, China, southern Europe and California are all experiencing drought. At the other extreme, countries such as Nepal, India and Bangladesh have suffered from extreme flooding in recent weeks. Almost all countries have made the link between climate change and water explicit in their Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement — which outline the actions countries commit to take in order to meet its goals — by including water as a central part of adaptation efforts, often ahead of agriculture and health, and also in the provision of sustainable energy, according to SIWI. Linked to this is the emerging area of innovation in “green infrastructure” — the use of trees, wetlands and other natural means of filtering water, protecting against floods, and replenishing groundwater supplies while protecting ecosystems — which has the potential to address both water and climate change concerns. Green infrastructure will be discussed during three sessions at this year’s conference, and at a side event organized by conservation and development NGO Forest Trends with the aim of developing a clear action plan for accelerating the green infrastructure agenda. 2. Gender and youth It has long been recognized that, in developing countries, women and girls carry out the majority of work — often unpaid — related to water and sanitation, including fetching water, laundry and managing hygiene for family members. The same is true within the workplace, and in agriculture and fishing. As a result, dirty and polluted wastewater poses a greater risk to women due to their higher levels of exposure. At the same time, the majority of decisions around water access are made by men and tend to favor men, according to Louisa Gosling, program manager at WaterAid UK, the world’s largest dedicated water NGO. While Gosling said that sessions on gender at previous World Water Weeks “have often been as side events, attracting a niche audience,” this time, the gender dimensions of water and wastewater has been named as a core theme. “[This] shows that gender has now been recognized as a theme that cuts through all other discussions,” she said, adding that the key question to address is “what do water professionals need to do to seriously promote gender equality in decision-making within institutions and within all aspects of investment in water and wastewater.” The World Bank has also been researching the link between gender inequality and water and will be launching a new report on the subject during the conference. According to Maitreyi Bordia Das, global lead for social inclusion at the bank, water-related development projects not only help address inequality in terms of access and work related to water, but can also promote gender equality more broadly. “Water is an arena where gender relations play out in ways that often mirror inequalities between the sexes … [and] exacerbate ingrained gender and other hierarchies,” she said, adding that “interventions that balance these relations in water-related domains can have a strong influence on furthering gender equality more broadly.” Decisions about water also tend to be dominated by older generations, according to SIWI’s Holmgren. The Stockholm Junior Water Prize, which will be announced next week, is an attempt to redress the balance. With competition entries received from 33 countries, Holmgren is confident the initiative is achieving its aim. “Water is often a male-dominated, middle-aged thing, but … this is a sign of an increased interest among the youth. It’s a matter of sustainability,” he said. 3. The value of water Meeting the specific water and water-reliant targets within the SDGs and the Paris Agreement requires massive capital investment to treat wastewater, develop new and more efficient water technologies, and repair and replace inefficient water infrastructure. However, experts say that because water has been grossly undervalued, the financial incentives to make these investments have traditionally not been there, leading many businesses and financial institutions to take water “for granted,” according to Holmgren. Similarly, neither governments, companies nor users are incentivized to use water more sparingly. All the while, the poorest often pay a disproportionately high amount for their water. However, this is now changing, Holmgren said, in part due to the realization by groups such as the World Economic Forum that the looming “water crisis” represents a huge threat to global society, as detailed in the 2017 global risk report. In response, he sees actors moving toward greater efficiency, as competition for water resources and scarcity has created the incentives to do so. This was not the case even five years ago, he added. “Now we come into a situation of scarcity and competition around water … [and] if you do run out of water you cannot produce anything, so there is a financial risk, and so [water] is becoming more and more interesting for companies and the financial sector,” he said. This is reflected in the fact that this year’s attendees include a record number from the private sector, Holmgren said, including commercial banks; companies; and innovative financing platforms such as the Green Climate Fund, which has financed integrated water resource management, sanitation, and flood risk management projects, and Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization working to create an international market for green and climate bonds. 4. Law and justice Sharing sources of freshwater such as lakes, rivers and aquifers is currently the norm for 145 countries with little history of conflict to date. However, as water becomes more scarce, conflicts are likely to increase, especially considering water agreements are only in place for one-third of these shared resources, according to U.N. estimates. This is likely to be a major topic for discussion at World Water Week. The winner of this year’s Stockholm Water Prize — Stephen McCaffrey — is an expert in international water law and has acted as a legal counsel during negotiations over shared water resources, for example between Argentina and Uruguay, and Pakistan and India. The law professor, who is currently at University of the Pacific, will receive the prize during a ceremony next week. 5. Pollution SDG 6 calls for improved water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials into water supplies. Related to this, representatives from the textile industry, including GAP, Nike, H&M, Target, C&A, Adidas and others, will present at the conference on their strategies for reducing wastewater and pollution, with a particular focus on China as a manufacturing hub. The World Resources Institute is also launching a report on the topic of high levels of pollution being pumped into waterways as a by-product of industry in a number of Asian countries, including Mongolia, Indonesia and Thailand. Much of this contaminated water is being consumed by poorer communities who rely on it for drinking, washing, farming and fishing, but the report finds that despite the existence of strong right-to-know laws, people are not easily able to access the information. A new study by the International Water Management Institute found that the use of untreated wastewater to irrigate crops is twice as prevalent as experts had previously thought, which could pose a serious risk to consumer safety.

But this year’s conference — organized by the Stockholm International Water Institute — aims to broaden out beyond its traditional realm of water use, sanitation and hygiene, attracting participants from across the development sector — including actors in health, agriculture and energy — and outside of it, including private sector players such as businesses, insurers, financiers and manufacturers. At the same time, the majority of decisions around water access are made by men and tend to favor men, according to Louisa Gosling, program manager at WaterAid UK, the world’s largest dedicated water NGO. According to Maitreyi Bordia Das, global lead for social inclusion at the bank, water-related development projects not only help address inequality in terms of access and work related to water, but can also promote gender equality more broadly.",1
38,91244,"Opinion: Thinking and working politically to strengthen agricultural market systems Down-and-dirty politics and political roadblocks have thwarted the success of agricultural development projects for decades. To achieve greater success, we need to consider how we can better understand and break down such blocks. Whether we like it or not, international development efforts are inherently political. Within the agriculture sector, the relationships and power dynamics among market actors influence who a market actor does business with, the nature of the deal made, and the overall competitiveness of the value chain. Dysfunction in these relationships can create space for inefficiency and corruption. For example, fertilizer imports are often controlled by a cohort of powerful traders, who are often allied with influential government officials. Even where good agricultural land is limited, politically connected firms can secure land rights to establish large commercial farms. Export bottlenecks that stymie most traders can be circumvented by companies with political influence. And these political manipulations are not limited to high-level players. A project designed to expand access to hybrid seeds, for example, might be deliberately stalled by politically connected input suppliers who stand to lose market share. Shifting the mindset If agricultural market systems are to become more inclusive and productive, we need a mindset shift. We must consider the long-term effects of power dynamics and shifting political landscapes in the agricultural sector and our market systems strengthening work. This does not mean interfering in politics. Instead, it means doing a better job of understanding market actors’ interests, motivations, relationships, and power dynamics, and anticipating who or what will drive — or block — progress within any given context. The U.S. Agency for International Development’s analytical approach to economic growth provides a potential framework when considering political dynamics. The “inclusive market systems” approach advanced by USAID characterizes a market system as “a dynamic space — incorporating resources, roles, relationships, rules, and results — in which private and public actors collaborate, coordinate, and compete.” They further define the systems as “those that engage and benefit a range of actors, including the poor, women, youth, ethnic minorities, and/or other marginalized groups.” And here is a link to thinking and working politically: “Since market systems contain sub-systems (household systems, value chain systems, etc.), and are connected to health systems, political systems, ecosystems, and the like, project implementers and managers are faced with the challenge of how to define the intervention space.” “The development community's link to and discussion of power dynamics and politics needs to be more robust and explicit.” --— The link between systems and politics But how are inclusive market systems connected to, and influenced by, political and other external infrastructures? USAID’s leveraging economic opportunities project attempts to probe these issues in case studies and a summary analysis of policy-constrained value chain initiatives under Feed the Future. They concluded that the causal link between project-driven policy interventions and effects on either enterprise growth or poverty reduction were loosely defined, if they were defined at all. However, the development community's link to and discussion of power dynamics and politics needs to be more robust and explicit. We propose that the thinking and working politically, or TWP, approach would help USAID’s Feed the Future programming illuminate the often down-and-dirty politics and power relations; formal and informal institutions; structural, social, and ideological underpinnings; and incentives driving behavior within the local ecosystem of actors and decision-makers affecting agricultural market systems. Political economy analysis as a tool A powerful tool used as part of the TWP approach is the political economy analysis, or PEA. USAID’s applied PEA field guide can help agriculture and Feed the Future projects and professionals use PEA — not only at the design or initial implementation phase to ensure politically savvy programming, but also as part of an ongoing adaptive management approach, per ADS 201, USAID’s operational model for programming in a specific region or country. PEA is a qualitative field research methodology that helps us go beyond analyzing technical and capacity constraints to identify the political, economic, and social interests and structural and institutional forces that can block or enable reform in the agriculture sector. PEAs generally identify constraints and causality in four areas: foundational factors, rules of the game, dynamics, and the “here and now.” It does not replace sound technical analysis; rather, it provides missing information about other factors inhibiting change and reform in the agricultural sector. Applied regularly, it can help us adapt to the changing context. By applying TWP approaches, including the PEA tool, we can improve the effectiveness of inclusive agricultural market systems’ design and implementation. In Serbia, the Leveraging Economic Opportunities project team applied the PEA approach to four market segments, including food processing and agriculture. In doing so, they identified opportunities for improving competitiveness, including a market platform that could improve value chain planning and pinpoint high-potential value chains for growth. On the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Agriculture project in Uganda, Chemonics applied an analytical framework based on Kingdon's 1984 three-stream model, identifying the problem, policy (solution), and politics (political will), before then ranking policy priorities. What are specific ways in which managers of agricultural market systems programs can think and work politically? We identify four options: 1. Integrate TWP and PEA as part of collaborating, learning, and adapting processes. PEA should be integrated into the CLA framework, now mandated by USAID as part of the program cycle (ADS 201). PEA delves into too-often ignored or assumed political dimensions and provides critical information on contextual factors otherwise missing from other assessments — but nevertheless crucial to inform program adaptation. The Chemonics-implemented agriculture and rural development support project in Ukraine has some interesting experience in this regard, having developed explicit feedback loops between political and policy lessons learned and the project’s CLA system. 2. Use PEA with capacity development models, including human and institutional capacity development. PEA can be used as one tool within the HICD performance assessment process to determine incentives and motivations, as well as other performance-related issues within the institutions we seek to strengthen. 3. Apply PEA to specific areas of a project that present significant barriers to success. If an agricultural project needs to develop an advocacy platform or network around a policy initiative, a PEA — including its analysis of the ecosystem of actors related to the issue or policy at hand — can be useful to ensure advocacy efforts are politically informed and consider all needed decision-makers. 4. Use TWP and PEA to nuance indicator selection for policy or political indicators, and identify those milestones that are critical to demonstrating progress. Now, as USAID refines its strategy for “country transition” associated with the global food security strategy implementation report, improved policy change indicators are of paramount importance. PEA tools could be used to understand local power dynamics and provide context to the CCIR.5 “Policy Matrix Progress Score,” now being developed for each Feed the Future target country. By thinking and working politically, and bringing to bear such tools as the PEA, we can improve our understanding of the political issues that can generate systemic change in inclusive market systems and create new opportunities for sustained enterprise growth and poverty reduction.

39,91248,"Opinion: A vision for a 21st century supply chain In the age of Amazon, efficient global commercial supply chains are essential for successful companies to deliver their products to consumers. These companies use sophisticated analytics, have end-to-end visibility in all aspects of their supply chain operations right down to the last mile, and operate with a level of precision that their customers demand. As we manage the United States Agency for International Development Global Health Supply Chain Program — Procurement and Supply Management Project, or GHSC-PSM, we are increasingly incorporating these commercial tools, techniques, and approaches, and adapting them into the low-resource settings that we serve. We recognize that the challenges we face are not experienced by established commercial supply chains of similar size and scope. Rather, our deliveries of life-saving health commodities are provided to areas with sometimes poor infrastructure, connectivity and, at times, places where civil order has broken down. At its core, our work is humanitarian. People, not profit, is what drives our mission. So, when we were challenged in the project’s second quarter of deliveries with a low on-time and in-full delivery rate, we knew we had to take action to turn things around. Over the past two quarters, we have addressed some of the structural challenges that were inhibiting our ability to achieve our goals. I’m pleased to say that in October, we achieved a 71 percent on-time delivery rate, have delivered 88 percent of everything promised to date, and are on track to achieve and sustain our goal of an average 80 percent on-time delivery rate in the next few months. This on-time delivery rate is being achieved with parameters that are more restrictive — with shorter windows of time for a delivery and more exacting metrics — than has ever been achieved by a program of our type. “Our goal is to pair private sector efficiency with a social mission.” --— James Butcher, executive vice president, Chemonics International In all but a few countries, we deliver primarily to central warehouses and not to the clinics or other service delivery points where patients get their medicines. We continue to conduct daily order prioritization and analysis to ensure that these warehouses do not run out of product. When there has been a delay in delivery, to date we have found no evidence that this has forced any patients off treatment. Does that mean we won’t continue to have some challenges? Of course not. The complexities of our work will continue, but we are now providing a service to our client and beneficiaries that is at least the equivalent, if not better than they have received previously. And with the early warning, incident management, data visibility, visual management, and other systems we have put in place, we have the capacity to detect problems early and ensure that they are systematically resolved. Although there are significant differences between operating global supply chains for commercial consumers and one for global public health commodities, we endeavor to run our global supply chain as any business would and our goal is to pair private sector efficiency with our social mission. Here’s how we plan to establish an efficient and cost-effective 21st century supply chain. Bring the best of commercial supply chains to global health GHSC-PSM’s goal is to ensure uninterrupted supplies of health commodities to save lives and to create a healthier future for all. To accomplish this, we work with partners all over the world to determine the best methods of operating a global supply chain that delivers essential commodities to those who need them when they need them. We take a patient-driven approach and are committed to ensuring we have as much visibility as possible into all ends of the supply chain and address any stock-level concerns. We’re actively working with governments, faith-based organizations, and other in-country partners to collect data and understand each country’s health commodity needs to ensure a consistent supply of lifesaving health products. To complement these efforts, the project has established a commodity security unit to systematically analyze ongoing commodity needs by using multiple data points to better understand the stock levels beyond the central warehouse to service delivery points throughout the country. All of this is giving us greater visibility than has ever been achieved before into the supply chain last mile. Our work in delivering vital medical supplies across the world also draws great strength from our strategic partnerships. Although we have a number of consortium partners, we’ve developed a mission-driven, one-team approach, drawing on the best experiences from the commercial, small business, and global health partners in our consortium. Their expertise, along with our innovative information technology system, allows us to track supplies in real time — and, crucially, to act quickly if there is a warning that supplies may be delayed. Introduce competition to increase efficiency and reduce costs One key way we increase efficiency and reduce costs is to bid out as many aspects of our supply chain as possible, including shipping lanes, ensuring that we can deliver more health supplies for the same dollar. Rather than partnering with individual logistics and warehousing firms as was the previous practice, we use “fourth party” logistics, a system whereby we continually compete for logistics services to obtain a best value in capability and cost. We make certain that all key delivery lanes and crucial warehousing contracts are put out to competitive bid at least once a year. For example, after conducting an optimization analysis of our network of regional distribution centers worldwide, we created a new strategy that is projected to save $38 million over six years through reduced warehousing and transportation costs. That is $38 million that can be used to procure more health commodities for more people. Consider market dynamics to lower prices We also drive greater efficiency by seeking the best possible pricing terms for the supplies we deliver. One key is leveraging our market influence around the globe to understand market trends and get the best deal possible. Another is doing in-depth analysis of the market dynamics that go into manufacturing medicines so we better understand manufacturers’ price points. Using this production economics analysis, GHSC-PSM has already generated significant cost savings and will continue to do so in the coming months and years. For instance, the project has negotiated contracts that have yielded $8 million in savings per year for an important HIV treatment, $1.3 million per year for viral load tests, and $1 million per year for malaria medication. Push for excellence The project’s focus on optimization is also yielding benefits at the country level. In Nigeria — one of the few countries where we are responsible for delivering commodities throughout the supply chain all the way to local clinics — the project has opened state-of-the-art central warehouses in Abuja and Lagos that have increased storage capacity and improved supply management, security, and delivery, leading to significant time and cost savings. We are also increasing the use of cutting-edge technology with our distribution partners — electronic proof-of-delivery notes, temperature logging, and real-time GPS tracking of fleets as products move downstream — to improve the quality of orders and deliveries, improve the efficiency of the system, and reduce total landed costs of deliveries. The cost savings for storage and transportation alone is projected to be $2.3 million this year. In this way, GHSC-PSM has enabled Nigeria to move forward with the most cost-effective tools that will enable lifesaving supplies to continue to reach those who need them most. Increasing data accuracy and visibility is also crucial to effective commodity delivery and management. GHSC-PSM is pioneering the use of several promising technologies for many countries, including a commercial off-the-shelf, as well as open source logistics management information system. In Malawi, GHSC-PSM introduced the country’s first ever web-based LMIS system, now operating in 33 hospitals and five health facility hubs, which provides a more streamlined and simplified visualization of stock levels to help trigger and expedite shipments to health facilities in need of resupply. This ensures hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies receive the medicines and supplies they need. Part of our effort in driving efficiency and quality is to emphasize a local approach to procurement. Rather than conducting all procurements centrally, we use a decentralized system in some cases to ensure that procurements are responsive to local needs and can be done flexibly and at lower cost. We have accomplished a great deal during these first two years and have already begun to see the increased flexibility, responsiveness, and efficiencies that come from building a strong 21st century global health supply chain. Although we’ve faced challenges during our first year of deliveries, we are back on track, and are seeing the benefits of incorporating commercial practices into all aspects of our work. Looking ahead, we remain as committed as ever to continual improvement and innovation — the people we serve deserve nothing less.

40,91328,"CDC kicks off new strategy with eye toward riskier investments LONDON — The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development will invest an average of 620 million British pounds ($815 million) per year in its development finance institution, the CDC, until 2021 — with the option to increase its average investment further to 703 million pounds ($925 million) per year depending on need — the Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel announced at the World Bank on October 16. The investment kicks off the CDC’s new strategy, published in July, which will see 20 percent of its capital invested in higher risk ventures with a lower guaranteed return on investment, for example, through its impact accelerator and new impact bond. CDC, which began investing exclusively in Africa and South Asia in 2015, will also take full ownership of those tools, which have formerly been owned by DFID but managed by CDC. They will now come onto CDC’s balance sheet, and will be funded through the increase in money. With the new resources, the U.K. will increase its use of development capital from 4 percent of the aid budget to 8 percent, placing it behind the Netherlands, Germany, and France for its use of development capital as a percentage of aid, according to statistics compiled by CDC. But while a new, less risk-averse CDC will allow the investor to walk the line between traditional development finance and traditional grantmaking, its Communications Manager Rhyddid Carter explained to Devex that it is still bound by the U.K. Treasury to deliver a 3.5 percent return on investment across its portfolio. As a result, Carter said, the majority of CDC’s work will seek safer, higher return investments, in order to finance those riskier ventures. “Following the increase in funding from government, we expect to be able to maintain current levels of investment of around $1.6 billion a year. Of that, up to a fifth — or $300 million a year — could go into higher risk, higher impact investments designed to tackle market failures that hold back development.” “[Those investments] will play a small but significant part, although the bulk of what we do, like other DFIs, will still be investments in businesses ready for commercial capital. We back businesses that are going to create jobs and make a massive difference using that commercial approach,” Carter said. Risky enough? Carter said a new arrangement with the Treasury will allow CDC to average out its ROI over time, and officials from the Treasury have agreed to exclude the riskier investments — namely those through the Impact Programme — from the 3.5 percent benchmark. CDC was criticized within the development community in years past for taking too few risks with its investments. In the past few years, for example, the CDC far exceeded its benchmark for returns, achieving on average a 7 percent ROI across its portfolio. “We did some work for the CDC reform in 2011, and so then and in our advice to the House of Commons, we realized CDC had been quite financially successful and had been able to increase their base successfully, but actually they’d lost sight of development impact,” Dirk Willem te Velde, head of the International Economic Development Group at the Overseas Development Institute and a research leader for the DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme, told Devex in a phone interview. “At that stage, the question was — and it was also raised to [the International Finance Corporation] — are you sufficiently innovative? Are you sufficiently targeting the frontier markets?” Already focused on riskier geographies than traditional DFIs such as the IFC, CDC appears to be mindful of those past critiques. The new strategy and its new understanding with the Treasury will allow the investor to maintain strong returns while also increasing risk. “The U.K. Treasury said we want you to continue to do well on the main, commercial portfolio, so have maintained the minimum 3.5 percent return target. But these higher risk ways of investing, they’re prepared to look at those and say, ‘OK, we may not have the same expectations around returns on investment.’” Carter said. “This increased flexibility means CDC can respond to opportunities to achieve additional impact, but the requirement to break even across the whole portfolio also means CDC does not require ongoing capital injections from the U.K. taxpayer unless an explicit decision is made by the government to scale up in the future,” he said. Asked if restricting CDC’s riskier investments to less than 20 percent of its capital base is sufficient given the gap in financing for less traditional ventures — for example, smaller manufacturing outfits or more innovative energy distribution schemes — te Velde said any increased risk is good news, but that in the future, CDC could do even more to target frontier markets. “With their existing capital base, I think they need to take risks,” te Velde said. “They need to look at it from a sector perspective; they need to look at what other actors are doing and other DFIs are doing, so it needs to be a different way of looking at things, a more collaborative way, but they’ve now got the capital to be more bullish.” Te Velde said observers will begin to see whether the new strategy is delivering on claims over the next six months. Asked what kind of investments it hopes to make, Carter pointed to ventures in the energy, health, and agriculture sectors, including debt financing for off-grid solar power, improving the access and affordability of health commodities, and a grantmaking program for feasibility studies across CDC’s investment portfolio. Space for new partners As a result of its new strategy and more focused geographies, CDC is also set to expand its presence in recipient countries: it opened a new Africa hub in Johannesburg, South Africa, this year, will open another in Nairobi, Kenya, and a third in West Africa in 2018. “My feeling is they will begin to be more visible in policy debates, both here in London and in-country,” te Velde said. Carter confirmed CDC hopes to grow its presence in-country, including through partnerships with organizations working in the region. Asked if the CDC will open up to partnering with development organizations in-country or with other development investors, Carter said: “Yes, definitely.” “At a corporate level, we’ve worked alongside civil society organizations such as the Ethical Trading Initiative on standards used by CDC investee businesses to improve their supply chain standards, and one of our investee companies, Jabong, was the first India-based company to join the Ethical Trading Initiative,” he said. He also said CDC is continuing to work with ETI in more recent retail investments, including companies Daraz in Pakistan and Jumia in Nigeria. CDC also works with academic organizations to help evaluate their impact, he said. “We know that several of the companies we work with would benefit from the expertise and partnership that local civil society organizations can bring, so we’re always keen, when appropriate, to connect them with the right support that’s out there,” he said. Measuring impact In the past CDC was critiqued by academics and the development community for its focus on measuring impact through job creation. Counting jobs is among one of the clearest metrics for assessing economic impact, but reliance on this strategy, some studies have found, can lead to ambiguous and in some cases non-inclusive growth. Carter confirmed the organization is working on a new framework for measuring impact in an attempt to look closer at how investors evaluate the effects of development capital. First, across its portfolio, CDC says it will continue to show annually how many jobs have been created, both directly and indirectly, using methodology “developed for us by industry experts,” Carter said. In addition, CDC will publish the taxes contributed to local exchequers and how much third-party capital is mobilized through its work. They continued: “Secondly, at a sector level, we’ll collect and publish annual data for certain metrics. In infrastructure, for example, we will track power generated and added capacity. We will also monitor and report selected job quality, gender, and climate change indicators.” Finally, at the “individual investment level,” CDC will track progress toward the intended impact for every new investment or fund commitment, using “whichever metrics will help us best understand if we are achieving our ambition.” Carter said this may include “indirect as well as direct impact, for example, if investment is in a manufacturing startup, the desired impact may not just be creating jobs and paying taxes, but new businesses created in the supply chain.” He said CDC can then compare these to its long-term vision of impact. With the new measures in CDC’s portfolio management process, Carter said the investor will be able to agree what to do to enhance impact, “in the same way we use financial measures to guide our strategic and operational work during the life of an investment.” He added CDC will also commission and publish at least 10 independent evaluations to better understand important related themes, such as the affordability of products and services for poorer groups in society and the impact of private health care companies on overall health care systems, “in order to bolster CDC knowledge, guide our future investment decision, and contribute to the wider understanding of the development finance community.” Update, Oct. 25: This article was amended to clarify that the U.K. ranks behind the Netherlands, Germany and France for its use of development capital as a percentage of aid.

He added CDC will also commission and publish at least 10 independent evaluations to better understand important related themes, such as the affordability of products and services for poorer groups in society and the impact of private health care companies on overall health care systems, “in order to bolster CDC knowledge, guide our future investment decision, and contribute to the wider understanding of the development finance community.” The investment kicks off the CDC’s new strategy, published in July, which will see 20 percent of its capital invested in higher risk ventures with a lower guaranteed return on investment, for example, through its impact accelerator and new impact bond. But while a new, less risk-averse CDC will allow the investor to walk the line between traditional development finance and traditional grantmaking, its Communications Manager Rhyddid Carter explained to Devex that it is still bound by the U.K. Treasury to deliver a 3.5 percent return on investment across its portfolio. Asked what kind of investments it hopes to make, Carter pointed to ventures in the energy, health, and agriculture sectors, including debt financing for off-grid solar power, improving the access and affordability of health commodities, and a grantmaking program for feasibility studies across CDC’s investment portfolio. “We did some work for the CDC reform in 2011, and so then and in our advice to the House of Commons, we realized CDC had been quite financially successful and had been able to increase their base successfully, but actually they’d lost sight of development impact,” Dirk Willem te Velde, head of the International Economic Development Group at the Overseas Development Institute and a research leader for the DFID-ESRC Growth Research Programme, told Devex in a phone interview. Space for new partners As a result of its new strategy and more focused geographies, CDC is also set to expand its presence in recipient countries: it opened a new Africa hub in Johannesburg, South Africa, this year, will open another in Nairobi, Kenya, and a third in West Africa in 2018. With the new measures in CDC’s portfolio management process, Carter said the investor will be able to agree what to do to enhance impact, “in the same way we use financial measures to guide our strategic and operational work during the life of an investment.” Asked if restricting CDC’s riskier investments to less than 20 percent of its capital base is sufficient given the gap in financing for less traditional ventures — for example, smaller manufacturing outfits or more innovative energy distribution schemes — te Velde said any increased risk is good news, but that in the future, CDC could do even more to target frontier markets. “At a corporate level, we’ve worked alongside civil society organizations such as the Ethical Trading Initiative on standards used by CDC investee businesses to improve their supply chain standards, and one of our investee companies, Jabong, was the first India-based company to join the Ethical Trading Initiative,” he said.",1
41,91440,"How can we improve the development impact of migrant remittances? BERLIN — Remittances are already a lifeline for many people in developing countries — but with reforms to the system, leaders across Europe and Africa believe they could become a key driver of global development. In 2016, foreign workers sent $429 billion in remittances to developing countries through formal channels, according to the World Bank. That is more than three times higher than official development assistance allocated in the same year — and the true figure is higher still. Since most transfers are done through informal channels, officials say it is difficult to estimate the actual total. But the system is plagued by problems, including issues surrounding access, transparency, bureaucratic hurdles, and — most seriously — significant fees and charges attached to even the smallest transaction. The World Bank reports that the average worker sending $200 back to his family in the first quarter of 2017 had to spend 7.45 percent — about $15 — on fees and charges. And that figure does not take into account the time or expense that the person receiving the money spends on traveling to an institution and recovering it. At a household level, those costs are significant. But extrapolated to a global level, they are staggering — an estimated $32 billion a year. There is now an international movement to improve the system, headlined by Sustainable Development Goal 10, which calls for the cost of migrant remittances to be slashed to 3 percent by 2030. But the effort is not just about saving money. The African and European leaders who participated in the November 2015 Valletta Summit want to better position the vast value of remittances within the global development architecture. Participants in the Valletta Summit saw what the drafters of the SDGs and others had earlier identified: charges to individuals that, if removed, could help pay for education and clean water and advance development at the community or national level. Working with recipients, officials could help guide money from remittances toward broader development priorities. Not just individual education, but better schools. Not just one latrine, but a neighborhood water and sanitation system. ""It's not only important from the perspective of people who deserve it and need it,"" said Mathieu Jacques, program manager for the ACP-EU Migration Action. Implemented by the International Organization for Migration, the Action, which is funded by the EU, works with governments and civil society organizations in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific to improve policies on a variety of migration-related issues, including remittances. ""It could be a substantially larger investment into the context where the money is being sent. It can be used to build communities up, promote equality and the diversification of economies,"" he said. The interest of European leaders is not purely altruistic. Since 2015, development cooperation has been a key tool for officials desperate to stem the tide of migrants arriving in Europe. Learning more about how remittances are sent and spent, and re-directing the fees involved, are obvious steps toward improving financial security for individual families and living conditions for entire communities. To that end, the Valletta Summit Action Plan promised to “promote cheaper, safer, legally-compliant and faster transfers of remittances” and to “facilitate productive domestic investments.” That would include programs to “increase the volume of transfers through formal remittance channels;” to “support financial education” of migrants and their families; and to “explore, identify and promote innovative financial instruments to channel remittances for development purposes.” Two years out from the Valletta Summit, however, the cost of sending remittances has barely changed and informal systems still dominate, demonstrating the complexity of improving the situation. The effort will require more than the recognition of African and European leaders, experts told Devex, but also the participation of global financial institutions, the redrafting of policies and a better integration of emerging technology. The value of remittances Remittances are the lifeblood of many of Mali's rural communities, according to Oumar Sidibe, president of the Migration and Development Initiative, an NGO based in the country's capital, Bamako. ""There are not jobs in these regions,"" he told Devex — and few entities interested in helping create them. ""There are a lot of people who live just because of remittances."" With work so scarce in rural Mali, community members travel abroad, hoping to find a position and send money back. Their role becomes even more critical when a problem emerges back in Mali — someone falls ill or a student needs money for school fees. Then an emergency request for funds might go out. If they do not come or they are too little, Sidibe said, it can be ruinous. The situation is a strain on the worker abroad, often in a low-paid position and scrambling both to make ends meet and find a way to help people back home. He must then factor in the cost of sending the money. Sub-Saharan Africa currently has the highest remittance costs of any region at 9.8 percent, according to the World Bank. Covering those fees may mean there is simply not enough left over for the surgery or the school term. The more popular informal channels, including money transferred through friends and family members, can be cheaper than formal ones, and also skirt bureaucratic hurdles such as registering for a bank account. On the other hand, it can take longer for the money to arrive, by which time it might be too late. There are also longer term consequences to the inefficiencies of the remittance system, because the money is not only spent on meeting immediate needs. Kenneth Coates, a development economist and professor at Rockefeller College, said that roughly 10 percent of remittances are typically saved by recipient communities, or else invested into microenterprises, which can help to sustain families and might eventually wean communities off their dependence on remittances. ""This impact can be leveraged by providing beneficiaries with financial literacy support at the community level, enabling them to make more informed decisions,"" he told Devex. IMIGRAD, in collaboration with ACP-EU Migration Action and the Malian government, took the initial step of fostering microenterprises in five rural villages over six months last year. Sidibe said they worked with 30 villagers receiving remittances to use some of the funds to develop livestock businesses, and that 90 percent of the businesses were deemed a success. He hopes that will eventually translate into growth and future job creation. There should also be opportunities to layer financial literacy work onto the program. Efforts like this demonstrate how remittances can be used to spur development. But that process could be accelerated by cutting down on remittance costs and moving more people into the formal system, which can help inform officials as they attempt to channel more of the hard-won funds into the communities they are intended for, and to track the effectiveness of the policies they create. Remittances could also be a first step in connecting people in rural Mali and across the developing world to the formal banking sector, opening up access to savings accounts and loan opportunities. The challenge ""This is a more complex area than it should be,"" Leon Isaacs, a remittances expert and CEO of Developing Markets Associates, told Devex. ""There are often two or three jurisdictions and a number of different parties involved."" Isaacs recently documented some of the major hurdles, including opacity around exchange rates and fees — problems that are exacerbated by a lack of financial knowledge among both senders and recipients. Most of the world’s major remittance corridors originate out of the United States or from the Middle East, with money going to countries including India, China, and Mexico. For countries in Africa, the majority of remittances are coming from Europe and the U.S. While not as large as some of those routes, Jacques said transfers within Africa are also a popular and important component of the remittance system. On the sending side, some participants are blocked from formal channels because they do not have the necessary documentation to open a bank account — a particular issue for undocumented migrants. Isaacs also highlighted the issue of de-risking, where financial institutions refuse to open accounts, or can close existing ones, over perceived regulatory risks. This issue is especially pertinent for senders to parts of the world where there are concerns about money laundering or that funds might be filtered into terrorist organizations. But most problems lie in recipient countries, where there are issues around exclusivity, with some money transfer companies pushing governments to introduce or maintain regulations that crowd other players out of the market. In some instances, these regulations force any new actors to coordinate with existing providers. In others, it restricts remittance services to financial institutions, which already have partnerships in place. There are also structural problems, including a scarcity of financial institutions where recipients can pick up their money. By pushing participants into informal channels, these challenges reduce global understanding of the remittance system and stymie efforts to align spending with larger development goals. What are the next steps? Part of the problem is that there is only so much that European leaders alone can do. One of the few specific commitments to emerge from the Valletta Summit was a pledge to operationalize the African Institute for Remittances (AIR), which was originally created in 2015. The European Union is funding AIR to the tune of $5 million over five years, according to its executive director, Amadou Cisse. With that support, he said, AIR is working to remove some of the main roadblocks on the continent. The institute launched with three goals: to reduce the costs of remittances; to improve statistical knowledge around the services; and to better leverage the money being sent. ""If you don't work on the costs, you won't be able to channel through formal channels,"" Cisse told Devex. ""Then it will be difficult to implement any kind of policy. And without accurate data, you won't be able to monitor or evaluate policies."" On the ground, he said, the main challenges have been addressing the regulatory environments in countries that crowd out competition and help keep prices high. AIR is currently working with six African countries — Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mauritania, Ghana, Malawi, and Zimbabwe — to craft new policies that will open the remittance market and help bring fees down. EU leaders are also funding other initiatives that could improve the conditions for sending and receiving remittances. In a bid to bring more transparency into the process, Germany runs a website comparing the different costs of foreign money transfers. And individual member states — particularly Germany — have begun showing an interest in pioneering additional efforts. For example, German leaders organized a conference last month to open discussions about the remittance corridor from their country to Ghana — an important channel, but one that Cisse said is plagued by a lack of competition. Opportunities for innovation are not limited to governments and institutions. Private sector and civil society organizations also have a role to play. For example, WorldRemit, a company launched in 2010, is using emerging technology to move away from traditional cash-based remittances and toward a cheaper, more efficient digital system. It has been particularly active in collaborating with mobile money networks — payment systems that are linked to mobile accounts and are hugely popular in many developing countries, particularly large swathes of Africa. Alix Murphy, WorldRemit's director of mobile partnerships, told Devex that 50 percent of the company's transactions in Africa are received in mobile money accounts. While cheaper than most cash-based systems, ""it's also the instantaneousness of it,"" Murphy said. ""For people who live their whole life in cash, they're going to have to take time off work, go stand in line. Now they can get the money straight to their phones."" Some challenges have proven more complicated to address. That is particularly true of areas that involve multiple institutions and governments, such as creating policies that give people access to formal banking sectors, and de-risking. Nevertheless, experts are confident that the range of advances happening in other areas mean remittance costs should soon start dropping. That, in turn, should encourage more people to enter formal channels and make it easier to fold remittances into larger development strategies. ""Quite frankly, it's fair,"" Jacques said. ""Remittances can easily be leveraged toward doing good in communities they're going to. Reducing the cost of sending them is something everyone can get behind.""

42,91489,"Opinion: We're losing 5 percent of global GDP to unsafe roads. Here's how to change that. From New Delhi to Cairo, pedestrians and drivers have long suffered from poor road conditions with dangerous consequences. According to the World Health Organization, more than 50 million people are injured and one million killed on the roads each year, with 90 percent of road traffic deaths taking place in developing countries. Unsafe roads also have a global economic cost of nearly 5 percent of GDP annually. Current approaches to improving road safety in developing nations aren’t working. Road investments and maintenance require resources that can far exceed the means of developing countries. Road safety strategies also require institutional capabilities that may not be readily available. Finally, data quality and availability on road safety represents a major challenge to the development and evaluation of any road safety policy. So what else can we do about it? Instead of seeking more hard-to-get resources, one solution can complement the current approaches by providing a handy source of data to make limited resources more effective. Many mobile-based traffic applications have been spreading throughout the developing world. From domestic applications such as Bey2ollak in Egypt to Waze in over 60 countries, drivers have started building online communities to find their way around traffic. Citizens access mobile traffic applications to post updates about congested streets, warn drivers about dangerous roads, point out the location of accidents and inform others of the nearest location of car services. With only a smartphone and internet access, users are able to provide a substantial amount of real-time data on road safety. These applications can also aid governments’ efforts to enhance road safety. First, governments can prioritize the limited funds they have for road maintenance based on users’ reports while accounting for the number of reports to assess the severity of the situation and the quality of the data. Second, limited police forces and traffic personnel can be deployed more effectively based on the users’ reports on unsafe or crowded roads. Third, governments can also prompt application developers to send notifications to drivers such as warnings about bad weather. The inflow of data can also warn ambulances, track the progress of road safety over time and inform other approaches the government pursues to improve the state of road safety. In order to implement this solution, governments in developing countries could partner with mobile application developers to build a low-cost platform to collect and analyze the mobile application data. This would take place in an environment that does not compromise the rights of the developers or the privacy of the users. Although the data would only cover locations where the app users visit (making it most effective in middle-income developing countries) the potential benefits of the solution remain quite high as those countries account for 74 percent of the world’s road deaths. At Dalberg, we have studied many potential benefits of this proposed solution and compiled a set of policies for the development and implementation of the proposed technological solution, which can help governments carry it out and hopefully help save the valuable lives of citizens around the world.

43,91612,"Google is teaching you how to use virtual reality to advance your cause SAN FRANCISCO — In a new 360 degree video, the Eastern Congo Initiative takes viewers to meet the farmers it supports, with the voice of actor Ben Affleck, who co-founded the organization, narrating the interactive experience. This nonprofit advocacy and grantmaking initiative is one of the organizations that Google worked with to pilot its new philanthropy program, Daydream Impact. The Silicon Valley-based technology company announced today that its virtual reality team will provide training and tools to organizations that want to produce immersive and 360 degree video content to support their causes. Daydream Impact will offer a free Coursera online training program, and those who complete the course can apply for six-month equipment loans and support from Google. Devex caught up with Sarah Steele, program manager on Google’s virtual reality team, to discuss the program and get a preview of its value for organizations working in global health and international development. “We had a lot of partnership requests, a lot of funding requests, a lot donation requests,” Steele said, explaining that there was a lot of interest from the nonprofit sector in products such as Google Cardboard, a low-cost head mount to view immersive content on smartphones. “It becomes really difficult to say ‘let’s support this program, versus this program.’” Steele leads Jump Start, Google’s camera loan program, and has managed a number of VR campaigns, including a project to ship out 1.3 million Google Cardboard units in partnership with the New York Times. She said she and Jennifer Holland, a program manager who works on products such as Google Classroom and Google Expeditions, which offers virtual field trips, put their heads together to figure out the most sustainable way to help nonprofits and other changemakers interested in using immersive storytelling to advance their work. The result was Daydream Impact, which is organized by three people within Google — one full-time and two part-time staff members. The Coursera course will take participants 10 to 15 hours to complete, and includes information on the different types of equipment needed to produce a 360 degree video; how to develop an idea; and what you need to think about for the various stages of the project, from scripting to camera work to promoting your video. The course represents all that the Google VR team has learned over the past three years. For example, when it comes to questions to ask yourself when developing an idea, Google proposes: Is there a reason to put the viewer in your scene? Will it give your viewers an experience that they otherwise couldn’t have? Will your recording environment be rich with things to see? Do you want your viewers looking all around versus at a fixed focal point? Will viewers want to continue watching beyond the initial ‘that’s cool’ moment? The Eastern Congo Initiative notices that when people visit Congo, it changes everything in terms of their future engagement. They wondered whether VR might create a similar experience for people for less money than flying halfway around the world. “From the beginning of ECI, storytelling has been a huge part of our mission. Most people in the world will never travel to Congo; never get to meet these incredibly resilient, resourceful people, working to better their country in the face of enormous challenges. We believe that VR has the potential to bridge that divide, to tell the Congolese story in a more personal, immersive way than traditional 2D video,” Dane Erickson, managing director of ECI, told Devex via email. “When we saw an opportunity to connect our supporters and the public at large to the Congolese people we work with, we jumped at that chance.” Erickson said he would advise other organizations to start by asking whether you have a story to tell. “Is there something intrinsic about the people you work with on the ground, or in the field, that will connect to viewers?” he asked. “Are there elements of your work that are hard to grasp unless you are there in person?” Those are important questions for organizations to answer in deciding whether to pursue a project like this, which requires an investment in time, if not money, he said. Harmony Labs, a nonprofit organization that tracks media influence, created three anti-bullying films as part of the pilot, and produced a toolkit on VR to inspire social change. The report explains how VR allows viewers to see the world through new perspectives; how spatial experiences enable viewers to interact with otherwise inaccessible places or times; and how experiencing the benefits of certain practices can lead to behavior change, to name a few examples. Harmony Labs also notes some of the challenges of working in VR, including audience reach and accessibility, since the medium is not yet pervasive; technological lifespan, since what was once state-of-the-art becomes outdated rather quickly with this technology; and ethics, since there is still more that needs to be understood about the psychological impact of VR. The barrier that Google is helping organizations overcome with Daydream Impact is expertise and expense. There remain relatively few individuals able to film and edit in the VR medium, and whether done in house or in partnership, production can be expensive. Organizations ranging from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia to the United Nations are experimenting with VR, and Google wants to lower the barrier to entry for smaller organizations with more limited resources. The Coursera online training program is available starting Wednesday, and applications will open every six months for equipment and support from Google. “The criteria we have for picking these organizations is we look for the measurability and impact of the project you’re trying to do,” Steele told Devex. The committee that selects projects will include representatives from the VR team, the Google.org team, the Geo for Good team, and the YouTube Impact team. “If you want to democratize a medium, which is what we want to have happen with VR, you have to let people fail in a space,” Steele added. “You have to give them the tools to test and experiment and potentially fail. Right now, it is very expensive to fail in VR.” Read more Devex coverage on technology.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The result was Daydream Impact, which is organized by three people within Google — one full-time and two part-time staff members.

44,91621,"USAID announces a new development impact bond SAN FRANCISCO — Mark Green, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, will announce a new development impact bond aimed at reducing maternal and newborn deaths in India, during the closing plenary of the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit. Launched Thursday, the Utkrisht Impact Bond, named for the Hindi expression for excellence, will fund maternal and newborn health in the Indian state of Rajasthan. DIBs are results-based contracts, in which investors — in this case UBS Optimus Foundation, a grantmaking organization focused on improving the lives of children — provide financing for social programs upfront. Then donor organizations — in this case USAID and Merck for Mothers — repay investors their principal plus a return determined by whether targets are achieved. DIBS are focused on outcomes, in this case improving the access to and the quality of care in up to 440 private health care facilities in the state, so that they achieve the new certification standard developed by the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals and Healthcare Providers and the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India. USAID and its partners are calling this the world’s first health impact bond, although these innovative finance tools are also being applied to eye care. And while Development Innovation Ventures is supporting a DIB on poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa, this is the first DIB from USAID outside of DIV. UBS Optimus Foundation will provide up to $3.5 million in initial working capital so service providers can begin their work with private facilities, and USAID and MSD for Mothers are committing up to $8 million in outcome funding if the targets are met. “This results-based financing mechanism is ground-breaking in that it takes a business approach to development, while still targeting basic needs like improving the quality of care and private facilities,” Green said in a press release provided to Devex ahead of the announcement. “By leveraging the assets and skills of a diverse group of partners across the public and private sectors, we are stretching our investments further while saving more lives.” This is the first DIB focused on maternal and child health, although there are other DIBs in the works targeting that issue, such as a DIB to implement Kangaroo Mother Care in Cameroon. And the Utkrisht Impact Bond is the latest in a number of recent announcements of DIBs as more organizations look to test the tool as an innovative way of financing global health and international development. What sets this DIB apart is the fact that there are two implementation partners — the nongovernmental organization Population Services International and the Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust, or HLFPPT — and the implementation partners are also co-investors, contributing more than 20 percent of the capital required. “The reason for that is the sense that we are working all together to create impact, and we also thought that would be much more attractive for the investors,” Phyllis Costanza, CEO of the UBS Optimus Foundation, told Devex. “The biggest challenge is de-risking these investments, because we are not delivering market rate returns yet, so we need to offer incentives for investors.” The UBS Optimus Foundation is also providing upfront funding for the Educate Girls DIB, also in Rajasthan, which Costanza called a coincidence. “While it's coincidental, it's really beneficial,” she said. “The Indian government is very interested in this.” She mentioned that the UBS Optimus Foundation is also working on another DIB in India, which has yet to be announced, and will work across several states. Within USAID, the effort to create and launch the DIB was led by the Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact, which works to bring a business-minded approach to the development, introduction, and scaling of health interventions, and USAID India. Costanza told Devex that conversations began in 2016, but the team lost a few months following the U.S. election, when there was some uncertainty as President Donald Trump took office as to whether this DIB would be a priority for the administration. Since then, the team has taken lessons they are learning from other DIBs, and they are trying to make their capital do more for less, for example, by getting payments from the outcome payers annually so they can recycle capital, she said. In a report on the emerging landscape for global health financing, USAID mentions DIBs among the nontraditional financing tools available to the agency. Other examples include pooled investment funds, such as the Global Innovation Fund, or grant funding that operates like venture capital, such as Saving Lives at Birth. The report mentions that Palladium received funding from Convergence, a blended finance platform, to design the Maternal Health DIB. The DIB grew out of the need to bring accreditation and transparency to private health care facilities, as the private sector accounts for more than 25 percent of hospital births in Rajasthan. Together, PSI and HLFPPT hope to save the lives of 10,000 women and newborns during the next five years in Rajasthan, which has 244 maternal deaths per 100,000 births and 47 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Having two implementers diversifies risk, Costanza said, and the hope is that PSI and HLFPPT will employ different models and learn from each other. “We need innovative and sustainable financing models to help solve some of development’s vexing challenges,” said Karl Hofmann, president and CEO of PSI, in a press release. “The Utkrisht bond is bringing together new funding partners motivated by social and financial returns, with the goal of improving the quality of maternal and newborn health services in the private sector — where a majority of Indian women go for health solutions. It makes perfect sense for us to meet the consumer there, and try to better meet her needs.” This DIB could have a transformative impact on how development is financed in the future, said Kim Bredhauer, CEO of Palladium, which designed the DIB and will manage its implementation during its three-year term. “This new results-based financing mechanism, which in effect is a public-private partnership, is bringing a commercial approach to international development and ultimately will save lives and taxpayer money,” he said.

45,91640,"Why the science of plant breeding needs to think practically CANBERRA — At the International Tropical Agriculture Conference 2017, held in Brisbane from November 20 to 22, the world’s leading scientists and researchers for innovation in plant, animal, and food sciences were brought together to discuss the issues and breakthroughs for the sector. On day one of the conference, a panel discussion on market-driven approaches to plant breeding highlighted the gap between science and demand in breeding — particularly in developing countries where some new breeds are being rejected by farmers and consumers because they are not practical to their way of life. For scientists and researchers breeding new plant varieties, there are key questions they must consider to ensure their work can improve livelihoods in developing countries. Vivienne Anthony, a senior scientific advisor with the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture working in Africa, spoke with Devex about the development challenges she has seen in plant breeding that fails to take into account market needs, consumer needs, and industry needs. And she urged for plant design to become a common fixture in education for breeders and researchers in this space. The importance of market research in plant breeding The nature of scientific approaches to plant breeding, Anthony explained to Devex, is a barrier to developing plants that are practical for their intended audience. “Although common sense should prevail, it is not always easy,” Anthony said. “If scientists are focused on achieving breakthroughs, they are too busy to talk to people, which could influence what it is you should be doing. Most scientists aren’t used to going out and doing market research, but they need to.” The importance, she explained, was to eliminate waste — in research time, money, and food. “The area I work in for the Syngenta Foundation in Africa works with plant breeders, and we knew there was a gap between science and need because many of the new plant breeds were not being adopted,” Anthony said. “Instead, people were carrying on growing things their grandparents had been growing. And we asked, why is that?” In Mali, scientists believed the green revolution could be replicated locally for rice. “But what they didn’t understand was they harvest is done by women who often have infants with them — usually carrying them — and this makes it difficult to bend down,” Anthony said. “The new breeds were not practical. But unless you are in these communities and know exactly how farming is taking place, how would you know that?” Anthony said this was a classic case where scientists could spend eight years trying to improve yield, only to see their scientific breakthrough rejected on the ground. In East Africa, new breeds of sorghum had also been rejected due to impracticality during cooking. In West Africa, plant breeding is creating fruits and vegetables that grow in a standard shape and size. But when aubergines in a uniform shape are packed, for example, they do not fit together tightly, producing more air in bags. With less produce per truck, this increases transport costs and reduces profitability. “So again scientists need to know how vegetables are transported to get the optimal shape,” Anthony said. “The whole thing is about communication, making science practical, and meeting people.” Collating the literature for improved knowledge While there are many cases like these that show the gap between the lab and the land, Anthony said they are difficult to find in literature and project reviews. “People are not going to write that their products are not being taken up, so when you hunt for examples you actually have to talk to people. Scientists often say they learned a lot, but it is not being written down.” Anthony is urging plant design to become mainstreamed. “Scientists need to think more about — which is what we all tend to do,” she said. “We need to spend more time really researching what people want, what is the best design and who we are breeding this for.” But when Anthony looked into who was teaching the design of plant varieties, she drew a blank. “There was no one,” she said. In response, she has been working in sourcing the expertise of researchers, scientists, and the private sector to develop resources to assist the best postgraduate breeding educators in Africa in developing training — including putting all of the best practice together in a teaching textbook, The Business of Plant Breeding. The aim, she said, is to encourage greater entrepreneurial approaches in determining the relevant new varieties needed within the public sector plant breeding. “If you start to look at smaller crops, especially in Africa where there is limited plant breeding apart from corn, that there needs to be more entrepreneurial spirit in public breeding and perhaps start-up type breeding organization that are more customer focused,” Anthony said. “They can use a business style approach to doing the science and benefit from early stage funding to support their research.” An action plan for changing approaches Anthony’s work, based in Africa and targeting the needs in Africa, will be investing in a range of training programs and workshops targeting early stage breeders through workshops. And the new training will be embedding the curriculum of a range of programs supporting plant breeding. “The next step we feel is really, really important — aside from training — is implementing ideas of best practice, supporting scientists in making the change and seeing how they are getting on,” Anthony said. “And in trying to support scientists to communicate through the value chain. This means talking to farmers, going to markets, speaking with transporters as well as consumers.” It also means talking to the rapidly growing urban consumer population and learning what they need and want to eat. She will also be advocating for a greater mandate of practical results of scientific research and funding. “There are two parts of science. You need science that is about breakthroughs in knowledge, but you also need science that has a practical application or it won’t be used. I believe more mandate is needed on this. It’s important because science takes so long.”",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"On day one of the conference, a panel discussion on market-driven approaches to plant breeding highlighted the gap between science and demand in breeding — particularly in developing countries where some new breeds are being rejected by farmers and consumers because they are not practical to their way of life.

46,91657,"A last mile solar startup wins big at Global Entrepreneurship Summit HYDERABAD, India — A distribution solution for energy products in rural India claimed the spotlight at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit on Thursday night, when founder Ajaita Shah won the event’s pitch competition. Emerging from a pool of 75 hopefuls, 24 semi-finalists, and four finalists, Shah was named the 2017 Global Innovation through Science and Technology Catalyst pitch competition Grand Champion during the closing plenary of the summit, which convened entrepreneurs and businesses from around the world in Hyderabad, India. The work of Shah’s 6-year-old startup, Frontier Markets, takes place far from the shiny lure of India’s tech capital. Frontier Markets responds to the market failure to provide rural, bottom-of-the-pyramid villagers in India with access, training, and servicing for clean-energy products, Shah said during a press briefing at the summit. The model addresses a lack of education in clean energy use, as well as a lack of trust in solar in rural markets based on inferior products purchased in the past, she added. “The twist is that we work with women entrepreneurs to deliver those services end to end,” she said, explaining a strategy that currently provides training to and employs 1,000 women entrepreneurs to sell products such as solar lanterns, home lighting systems, power inverters, and clean cook stoves. Frontier Markets trains women — who earn a stipend and commission based on sales — in marketing, sales, and technical repair: “They are the ones that are there for the after-sale service,” Shah said. “They really are the center of this entire model in terms of solution.” With a background in microfinance, Shah herself worked for years in rural villages throughout India and dealt with the pain points that come from lack of energy access, she said. Seeing the role that women could play firsthand, she knew it was time to start something herself that would create a much larger impact. “We’re working with women who got married at the age of 14, who are now 33 years old, have five kids, are uneducated, who are kind of lost in this entire value chain … and they are dying for an opportunity because they want to be able to take a stance to prevent their 14-year-old daughter from getting married,” Shah said. The startup already partners with finance institutions to provide consumer financing, and works with companies such as Philips, as well as solar social entrepreneurs. But 70 percent of the products they sell are manufactured in partnership with Indian manufacturers, Shah said. The group also just partnered with Barefoot College, which focuses on women’s empowerment and electrification through solar power in rural communities, and relies on several partners in the NGO space to supplement their economic empowerment with social empowerment programs. “As you can imagine, ‘cracking the last mile,’ as they say, takes a lot of different pieces, and the reality is we aren’t going to be good at everything,” Shah told Devex. To date, 1,000 women entrepreneurs have generated $2.5 million in revenue by selling solar-powered systems to 400,000 rural households. Staying lean, Frontier Markets has raised about $1.5 million, but with new capital investment, Shah is looking to scale to six new states in India with the goal of reaching 21 million people with 10,000 women entrepreneurs to drive larger revenue and “go deep into that last mile,” Shah said. As the GIST Grand Champion, Shah will receive a suite of prizes, including $50,000 in Amazon Web Services credits, a Dell laptop computer, an exclusive virtual mentoring session with an Amazon executive, and $100,000 in Google Cloud credit and services from Alice, the artificial intelligence tool for women business owners.

47,91664,"From pirate ships to iPhones: What it takes to ‘get things’ into complex environments The craziest thing Wilhelm Du Toit has ever secured for a client was a pirate ship. “People asked to be evacuated, and that was the solution,” said Du Toit, South Sudan’s country manager for Global Mission Support Services, a company focused on helping people and organizations with logistics worldwide. Stringent about not breaking his client’s nondisclosure agreement, Du Toit doesn’t divulge too much. In the little he reveals, it was clear that this was an emergency situation, all regular shipping was grounded and surprisingly, he quipped, it wasn’t that hard to find. “It was an innovative solution to a very dire situation,” Du Toit said. Two thousand people were evacuated that day as the pirate ship made several trips shuttling civilians to safety. Although the ship was out of the company’s usual wheelhouse, Du Toit says it is well in line with what they do: Enabling people in austere environments. As the world’s youngest nation enters its fifth year of conflict, with more than 4 million South Sudanese displaced from their homes, over 50,000 people killed, and 1.25 million on the brink of starvation, the already complex situation is compounded by logistical challenges. Humanitarians and private organizations say complications include risks up and down the supply chain, such as rigorous customs clearances, volatile security on the major import routes, and an overall harsh operating environment — one that often lends itself to the overpricing of regular transport and cargo services. Though Du Toit is uncertain of a concrete number, industry experts estimate that roughly 6.4 million tons — $426 million — of imports such as sugar, medicine and logistical supplies make their way into South Sudan by road each year, he said. Aid agency Oxfam has been operating in South Sudan — formerly Sudan — since 1983, working on humanitarian response, advocacy and women’s rights issues. Due to their extensive work with water and hygiene sanitation, some of the organization’s major procurements regularly include materials for drilling wells, solar pumps and panels, and hygiene kits with soap, sanitary pads and buckets and water purifiers among other things. Nelson Warambo, Oxfam’s country logistics coordinator, says there are often impediments to bringing supplies in. “Custom clearance can take longer than expected,” said Warambo, adding that they have to practice patience, as “there’s nothing much else” they can do. Although many agencies, including Oxfam, have their own internal logistic teams, Du Toit says they don’t always have the regional or international access, or the right connections. GMSS is one of a handful of private organizations operating in South Sudan that is focused on making it easier for NGOs, businesses and people who want to make things happen quickly. The company works with “anyone who needs anything brought in.” From foreign governments to departments of state and the United Nations to individuals and NGOs, they’ve shipped in goods from armored cars to iPhones to machines that print labels. GMSS only turns down about 10 percent of requests, and they attribute their procurement success to the company’s tailored approach, their ability to build trusted local relationships and the time they invest with each client. “We’ll see every single government department and write letters and give supporting documents,” Du Toit explained. GMSS’ eight permanent staff on the ground assume much of the responsibility and the risk for what it is that they’re trying to get, he added Although they operate worldwide, with a permanent presence in six countries and a smaller footprint in 15, South Sudan is GMSS’ first foray into East Africa. What makes the country particularly challenging is the pervasive culture of suspicion, Du Toit said. “The biggest restriction is the paranoia of people who should enable development,” he said. A request to bring in a medical evacuation helicopter was denied, for example, on the grounds that flying a helicopter in the capital of Juba would be a “threat.” “It’s a flying ambulance,” Du Toit said. “It’s there to rescue people out of the river. If someone in the government gets injured, we can have them back in Juba on life support within an hour.” Other complicated items include anything deemed hazardous. The government adds increased restrictions on something like a personal flotation device because the Co2 cartridge is a high-pressure vessel. “People just want a life vest, but they don’t realize it’s a restricted item,” Du Toit said. Shipping in one PFD can cost upwards of $300 a piece for an item that’s usually $180. With more restrictions, there’s more paperwork, more clearance and more authorization, which means more money, says Du Toit. He says companies are willing to pay for the efficiency, but in general he’s found it hard to penetrate South Sudan’s international organizations due to the “non-permissiveness” of the environment. “People close up and organizations want to do everything in house because they don’t want to expose themselves to risk,” he said. In order to get new clients he’s had to personally go door to door in Juba, so that people would speak to him, says Du Toit. However, Warambo says that’s a misconception. “We are quite different from corporate entities,” said Warambo of Oxfam. Most international organizations are guided by certain policies and principles, he said, which companies outside the humanitarian space might “find limiting.” “Procurement within NGOs follow certain donor regulations,” says Warambo. “There are set procedures like types and methods of procurement which are stringent and not as strict as in corporate. It is easier and quite possible for a corporate entity to buy an item from sites like Amazon, which might be possible for Oxfam but not as feasible.” Even though Oxfam has its own procurement and logistics team, Warambo says if a company is able to get goods out of the port efficiently and quickly and has a good rapport with the relevant people, he’d be open to working with them, as they often struggle with challenges such the scarcity of reputable supplies, obtaining exemption documents and getting things during the rainy season. GMSS recently launched its online platform with the aim of establishing “first world efficiency” for both government and NGOs in South Sudan. It’s the first website of its kind in South Sudan with a secure payment method so people can order anything from consulting, aid, logistical help, consular, transport, or financial services at the click of a button. “We do anything you can imagine,” Du Toit said.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Two thousand people were evacuated that day as the pirate ship made several trips shuttling civilians to safety.

48,91666,"Montego Bay Declaration informs next steps for sustainable tourism for development MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica — As the United Nation’s International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development winds to an end, delegates gathered in Jamaica to discuss what’s needed to ensure that tourism is an engine of good job creation, inclusive growth, and sustainable development. While the past year has helped raise the profile of tourism as a tool for sustainable development, it’s an industry that hasn’t always led to the type of inclusive growth that the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals demand. The U.N. World Tourism Organization’s global conference on jobs and inclusive growth in Montego Bay last week emphasized that partnerships will be key to future growth, but also discussed how the evolving industry will demand that companies and countries do things differently. It’s an industry that accounts for about 10 percent of global gross domestic product and is growing consistently — growth that could either be an opportunity to make the world a better, more peaceful place, distribute wealth, protect natural and cultural resources, or not, said Taleb Rifai, secretary-general of the U.N. World Tourism Organization. “We have to continue to lower the walls between host communities and visitors. We cannot let visitors live in bubbles — that is not acceptable anymore,” he said. “We cannot continue to promote modern-day plantations in our own countries, called exclusive resorts.” While exclusive or all-inclusive resorts have played an important role in tourism development in many countries — including Jamaica, which hosted the conference — it’s not a model that will speak to the future traveler and it has too often left communities behind, Rifai said. Tourism as a tool for sustainable development will require buy-in from stakeholders across the industry’s spectrum and participation from the communities it touches — and Rifai hopes to power it forward with the Montego Bay Declaration. The declaration The global conference in Jamaica’s tourism epicenter culminated with the presentation of the Montego Bay Declaration, a nonbinding agreement outlining a series of actions and commitments designed to help different actors achieve the goals of inclusive sustainable growth through tourism. The declaration begins by acknowledging that tourism has a role in contributing to the SDGs, and that there is an urgent need to “mobilize and unlock a substantial increase in financing tourism development.” Building on themes of the week’s conversations, the declaration highlights the importance of a variety of actors — from governments at all levels, to the private sector, international organizations, academia, and local communities — partnering to achieve the SDGs through tourism. One actionable result will be the creation of a working group to build a plan to encourage donors and corporations to invest more heavily in sustainable tourism. But all those engaged in the industry will “develop an integrated and holistic approach to tourism development in order to leverage the sector’s positive impact and multiplying effect on people, planet and prosperity, thus capitalizing on its value as a key contributor to sustainable development,” the declaration reads. Stakeholders should build models that engage and empower communities, create “decent jobs,” and bring down barriers between communities and tourism developers, according to the document. It also touches on a need for improved data, enabling environments that incentivize inclusive and sustainable growth, the need for more donor support through both new and existing finance frameworks, and programs that help educate and build skills for youth, women, and other at-risk groups. The declaration also highlights the need for climate change mitigation and improving crisis preparedness, including a commitment among Caribbean countries to work toward more regional integration and to support a Global Tourism Resilience Center in Jamaica, including a Sustainable Tourism Observatory to help in preparedness, management, and recovery from crises. While the declaration may provide broad brush strokes of some of the key issues moving forward, it shouldn’t be considered a roadmap or action plan, Rifai said. It is intended to be a set of principles and references that different actors can take on and develop into individual action plans. The way forward More money, better policies, and new partnerships are required moving forward — and governments, the private sector, and donors all have specific roles to play. Less than 1 percent of financing from multilateral financial institutions go to tourism, and there need to be more opportunities for financing, including for small and medium tourist enterprises, Jamaica’s Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett told the audience at the conference. He called for a “rebalancing” of that spending. While historically multilateral development banks have not invested heavily in tourism, both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank told Devex they are looking to increase their investments in tourism. The World Bank has already supported some programs that empower local communities to develop tourist opportunities or improve their agricultural goods and link them to markets so that they can supply the local tourism industry. Those approaches of finding linkages from tourism to other industries is important for local communities to benefit, but it may also require government incentives or partnerships to bring the private sector to the table or get them to more often work with or source from local companies. Tourism can be complex, which is in part why governments have been turning to the World Bank to ask for help in crafting policies, identifying their competitive advantage, detecting barriers, and developing effective policies and plans, John Perrottet, a senior tourism specialist at the World Bank, told Devex. What’s needed, he said, is a recognition that there is a data gap that is hindering growth and planning, and that governments need to more effectively coordinate tourism development to make it work for everyone — including women. Tourism is one of the few sectors where there is gender parity in employment, but future inclusive growth will require women moving up the chain to be decision-makers and leaders, said Louise Twining-Ward, a World Bank senior private sector specialist in tourism. To that end, the bank is looking at how the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, or We-Fi, which is a new facility to fund women entrepreneurs in developing countries, can be used to help support women in the tourism industry. Some of the necessary shifts will also be driven by the changing demands of travelers, who are increasingly looking for more authentic travel experiences: “We can’t build 5-star hotels in 3-star communities,” Rifai said, adding that communities must benefit from and be engaged in tourism. Airbnb released several partnership case studies, where they are working in developing countries to help local people post on the platform and become hosts. But it’s likely these initiatives or similar will require a push from governments to achieve inclusive growth. Resorts could move away from all-inclusive models slowly by giving guests vouchers to eat at local restaurants or go to local communities to see performances, rather than staying within the boundaries of the resort, suggested Rifai. Governments can also incentivize companies, through policies such as tax breaks, to buy products locally, particularly from surrounding communities. Factoring in climate change Considering many tourism-dependent locations are often also at great risk for the impacts of hurricanes, future work must also focus on resilience and long-term planning to preserve the environment, said Cecile Niang, World Bank program leader for Caribbean countries. It was clear that the devastation caused by this hurricane season was fresh in the minds of many at the gathering. Building more sustainable models for tourism, installing more renewable energy capacity, and creating better systems for recovering from disasters, including how to communicate post-disaster, are all on the agenda. Climate change mitigation and adaptation, in fact, should be the top priority, said Geoffrey Lipman, the co-founder of the SUNx, Strong Universal Network program, a climate resilience system for tourism destinations that is managed by the Green Growth & Travelism Institute. Measuring climate impacts is critical and must inform planning processes, which may mean that future infrastructure or property development shouldn’t happen right on the water where they are most vulnerable to storm surges, he said. Protecting the environment doesn’t need to mean stalling growth, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Michael Holness told the conference, adding that tourism play a role in educating local communities who can help in the process of preserving the environment. “Tourism-dependent countries must critically consider how tourism products should adapt and evolve to new realities like climate change and evolving tourist interests,” he said. In Jamaica, he is working on improving tourism infrastructure, but also making life better for citizens, who will help create the authentic experiences that visitors want, Holness said “Tourism can move nations from poverty to prosperity,” he said. “Tourism must ensure inclusive growth where everyone participates in the growth process and benefits equally in growth. It must have an impact and make communities better places, and by extension, greater nations.” Editor’s note: The Jamaica Tourist Board facilitated Devex's travel and logistics for this reporting.

49,91676,"USAID's newest gender-focused programs represent 'true collaboration,' Green says HYDERABAD, India — In early 2018, the United States Agency for International Development will issue an open call for proposals for innovative ideas to bridge the “gender digital divide,” or gender inequalities caused by barriers such as network coverage, online security, cost, and technical literacy. The initiative is one of several announcements the agency made at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India’s tech capital last week, all aimed at empowering women. Improving women’s access to technology “hits all sectors … the data and research and our empirical knowledge shows that, especially for women entrepreneurs and women’s economic development, it’s a game changer,” said Michelle Bekkering, USAID’s senior coordinator for gender equality and women’s empowerment, of the agency’s $1.5 million commitment to the challenge. “If you have a mobile phone, you can be in a village in West Bengal, but you can have access to your own money and you can do e-commerce. It opens the world to you.” The gender data gap initiative, named WomenConnect, was launched alongside a new competition for women-led enterprises to access investment and other business services to take their food businesses to the next level, led by the U.S. Government's global hunger and food security initiative Feed the Future. “We want to give entrepreneurs out there the opportunity to pitch the idea and go with it,” Bekkering said. Both new challenges align with USAID Administrator Mark Green’s overall strategy — which focuses on innovative private sector relationships, “strategic transitions” for countries to wean themselves off U.S. assistance as well as technological innovation, as reported by Devex in September — he told Devex in Hyderabad. “What we are trying to do at USAID is tap into the strength, the innovation, and the creativity of the private sector to take on development challenges,” Green told Devex during a press conference at the summit. “We're trying to move away from the traditional relationship, which was often a contracting relationship with the private sector, and there's nothing wrong with contracting — we will continue to do contracting — to move to a model of true collaboration in which we work with the private sector to co-finance programs, to co-design programs, to take on challenges jointly.” Another example of this approach is the launch of USAID’s first health impact bond, the Utkrisht Impact Bond. Through this public-private partnership, launched Thursday at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, private capital will front the costs to improve the quality of health services in private health facilities in Rajasthan, India — and USAID will pay back the investment only if the providers achieve certain concrete results. USAID and MSD for Mothers are committing up to $8 million in outcome funding if the targets are met. “What we want to do is to lay out a challenge that we see as a development agency: Maternal and child health, and say, you know, look, help us get to the goal of achievement in maternal and child health,” Green told Devex. The increase in life-saving supplies and trained staff, and the improved ability to address complications in labor could save the lives of as many as 10,000 women and newborns over five years, according to USAID. “I think the model's a very good one because it truly harnesses the strength and creativity of the private sector, and while this is the first, I don't believe it will be the last,” Green said. There are “a number of innovative financing techniques” that USAID is considering adopting in many places, Green said. It’s possible those investments will address the security and education challenges faced by women in conflict zones and crisis settings — areas USAID’S Bekkering says are receiving an increased focus within the agency. “One of our chief concerns right now is that there are 66 million displaced people around the world,” she said. “This is a huge challenge. The administrator has looked at us and said, ‘If we don’t make sure that there are education opportunities in camps, in transit areas, we will lose whole generations of children.’ This is something that will have a strong gender focus, and I think this is something you will see us talking more about.” Women’s economic empowerment will also continue to be a focus within the agency, as will “tech as an accelerator in all of our empowerment programs,” Bekkering told Devex.

50,91686,"Inside OPIC's new way of looking at deals HYDERABAD, India — The future holds far more “gender lens investing” for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. But to say the United States government's development finance institution has a “renewed focus” on gender wouldn’t be quite accurate, according to Kathryn Kaufman, the agency’s new managing director for global women's initiatives. “What OPIC does as a development finance institution is reach the places where the market most needs us — and by definition that often means women,” said Kaufman, who joined OPIC in late August. “We have over $1 billion in microfinance, 90 percent of which goes to women, so gender is part of our DNA.” Still, historically there hasn’t been an outright focus on women at the nearly 50-year-old agency, which mobilizes private capital to help solve development challenges in industries from critical infrastructure to health care and technology, and currently has a $21.5 billion portfolio of loans and guarantees in more than 100 developing countries. In an effort to modernize and jumpstart that gender focus, OPIC President Ray Washburne brought Kaufman on board to head up what was originally referred to as a “women’s initiative” at the agency — but the word “initiative” suggests it might have a beginning and an end, and her mandate has grown far larger than that, Kaufman told Devex on the sidelines of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad. Now, Kaufman is focused on building an internal task force to help her rewrite policy and change the way OPIC does business to make sure it’s delivering for women. The former venture capital fund partner got a taste of the task in front of her on her second day, when she reviewed a deal that would soon come through to the investment committee. It can take anywhere from one to 12 years for a deal to come in front of the board, and it is almost always “fully baked” when it does, Kaufman said. But in this case — a $65 million loan facility to one of the largest banks in Costa Rica — Kaufman still had a few important questions for the loan officers: “I said ‘OK what’s the gender component of this deal?’ And [I was met with] blank stares, they never considered that.” In the end, they were able to enforce several strong gender policies from the partner bank, Kaufman said, as they determined to allocate 20 percent of the deal toward lending to women entrepreneurs. Currently, “we have to look at a deal-by-deal basis, and find out ‘what can we do to push the needle on this particular transaction?’” Kaufman said. “But our priority is not having the ‘one-off 20 percent of this loan goes to women,’ our priority is institutionalizing gender equality in these banks.” The main pillars of gender lens investing at OPIC rest on access to finance, access to jobs and access to services that provide more economic opportunity for women — and the agency wants to play a role in shaping the criteria that determines what it means to offer a service that intentionally provides more economic opportunity for women. They’re starting by adapting their own matrix to encourage it. OPIC’s investment officers are motivated and make decisions based on OPIC’s development matrix, which helps it score opportunities depending on indicators such as whether the deal would provide or transfer a new technology, or enter a minority market. Now, “How are you contributing to gender equality?” will be among the most important questions a loan officer can ask. “It’s not about adding cost, it’s about asking questions to get the best solutions for half the people who will be riding the train.” --— Kathryn Kaufman, OPIC’s managing director for global women's initiatives In the meantime, OPIC is already asking questions of private sector partners that they might not have asked before: “If we’re financing a wind farm, we are asking questions to our sponsor companies like how many women are you employing? Are there women in leadership positions?” Kaufman said. if the institution is financing a large infrastructure project such as a metro, meanwhile, their loan officers are now asking questions about whether the platforms are well lit, or whether the gap on the platform is safe for strollers to cross. “It’s not about adding cost, it’s about asking questions to get the best solutions for half the people who will be riding the train,” Kaufman said. OPIC hasn’t brought in new talent aside from Kaufman to make these changes, but the gender lead has recruited a task force of existing employees across business lines to create a team of 13 people — OPIC consists of about 250 employees total — willing to dedicate time on top of their current work to the endeavor of making OPIC deals answer for women. The agency will also likely contract experts in gender to conduct trainings with loan officers. “We’re turning the lens on ourselves as well,” Kaufman said of examining gender parity within OPIC’s walls. Although OPIC is staffed by about 50 percent women and most of their top leadership positions are also held by females, “it’s not institutionalized,” said Kaufman, who gave her original presentation on gender lens investing to an OPIC board consisting of only one female member. If the agency is going to require companies they invest in in Guatemala, for example, to have 30 percent female board representation, this should also be reflected within their own organization. “At OPIC, we believe it’s important to lead by example, which is why we are making internal reforms in tandem with our shift in focus to gender lens investing,” Kaufman said. OPIC will make an official announcement in March 2018 to share the name of the gender task force, as well as the amount of money that will be attached to their gender investing: “That’s going to be a really big number,” Kaufman said.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,"What OPIC does as a development finance institution is reach the places where the market most needs us — and by definition that often means women, said Kaufman, who joined OPIC in late August.

51,91687,"Attention chiefs of party: Here's how to have a successful project launch “Chief of party” is the job title most commonly used for the overall project lead on a United States Agency for International Development-funded program. While the exact duties of a COP can vary, this person plays a critical leadership role in the launch and management of a project. Tasked with overseeing project implementation, the COP is involved in a wide range of activities from hiring staff, to guiding project strategy, to managing financial budgets and donor relationships. Devex spoke to several professionals with chief of party experience in a range of regions and sectors to find out what contributes to a successful project launch and what they would do differently next time round. Here’s what they said. Recruit the right people During the startup phase, chiefs of party should invest considerable time in hiring the right people. Identifying a strong team from the beginning is one of the “critical responsibilities” of a chief of party and something that can make or break the project, says Jane Kellum, an education and gender specialist who was COP for more than two years for a Care project in Haiti. Things can of course be tweaked and fixed further down the road, but it is more difficult she adds, so “establishing and finding the right team from the very beginning is a critical part of that beginning launch of the project.” Kate Heuisler, who is currently overseeing USAID’s Development Innovations project in Cambodia, agrees that staff are one of the most critical elements for project success, particularly “the quality and diversity of the people on the team.” When it comes to hiring, Kristi Ragan, who is based in Washington, D.C., as chief of party for USAID Invest, doesn’t stick to rigid criteria and appreciates candidates who are more interested in “doing real, relevant work” than the job title or profile. “I look for people who are a bit hungry to break into the space and who don’t have the perfect resume,” says Ragan, because skills in collaboration, team building, flexibility, risk taking, client management, and “having your colleagues’ back” are not always apparent in a resume. “These are the skills of adaptive management,” she adds “You have to frame questions that show you value these traits and find ways to see if the candidate does also.” “At the end of the day, every project is only as good as its entire team.” --— Jane Kellum, education and gender specialist Ragan also pays attention to a candidate's reaction after she tells them that the scope of work often becomes obsolete within the first five minutes of a job, especially those roles dealing with new approaches and innovation in international development. “If the candidate smiles then I know they are willing to trust me with their lives and future happiness,” she says. Finally, a candidate displaying a sense of humor, which can be a bit of a gamble in an interview, is a plus for Ragan, who believes it shows their capability for partnering and collaboration, and that they are willing to take a risk. Engage stakeholders The COP is, in a way, the face of the project says Kellum, so a huge part of their role is making sure that all stakeholders — donors, host-nation partners, target beneficiaries, and staff — are involved in the planning and understand they are “part of the vision.” For Heuisler, the launch is essentially an announcement of the project’s intentions — to ensure key stakeholders and the public understand the project, and know how its services or programs can be accessed. In order to do this, the COP must identify, invite, and engage the right stakeholders, and ensure the description of activities is accessible. Communication is key, and better to feel like you are “overcommunicating” says Ragan, as insufficient communication can lead to confusion, distrust, and wasted resources with stakeholders. Ragan also believes in being authentic with stakeholders and showing them that you are willing to speak honestly. “I absolutely want to make a strong case that I have no success without their success,” she says, “so that I establish a collective commitment to the activity because we both want to succeed.” Focus on internal relationships Building relationships internally is also key to success says Kellum, because “at the end of the day, every project is only as good as its entire team.” That means building trust on all levels — between other staff, and between staff and leadership. Leadership can’t just be closed off in a room, only having high-level discussions. They also need to be sitting around the dinner table with staff and pitching in with the “non glamorous” aspects of the job, says Ragan, emphasizing face-to-face time is very important in “forging a team.” And while the client is important, Ragan says her first priority is always ensuring that her team is well functioning, a key to actually achieving quality deliverables and client satisfaction. Understand the proposal Kellum had been involved in writing the proposal for the project in Haiti before moving to the chief of party role. While this is not typical, she found the background knowledge and insight extremely beneficial. One of the main roles of a chief or party is “mapping out what is the way forward” she explains but in most cases, someone writes the proposal then someone else is hired in “to interpret that and make it come to life.” This is one of the “deficiencies in development” says Ragan — proposals are drafted without sufficient knowledge of the context, then handed off to a new team who wasn’t involved in the design and might not completely understand it. Ragan has served as COP on four USAID contracts and says that her involvement in the proposal generation contributed to the success of each of these. “I could say ‘no that’s not what they need,’” and make sure the implementers were not just “dreaming up something pie in the sky,” she explains. The COP is responsible for implementing the project, so they first have to really understand the proposal it is based on. Set aside sufficient time for planning workshops, ideally when your team has been identified and are able to participate, to go over the proposal. Make sure everyone has the same vision for the project, and have a solid plan in place from the very beginning which reflects this. Find the balance between technical expertise and people management While the chief of party is ultimately a leadership role, they must also have some understanding of each of the different technical aspects involved the project. Steve Gorzula, who has served as COP on environmental projects in Pakistan, Mozambique, and Nepal, says that in order to make sure the work plan is on track, the COP has to be a “technical manager [and] be functionally literate in all the different fields that make up that particular project.” For Ragan however, one of the most important lessons for succeeding as a COP was learning to let go of the technical work, despite having a strong technical background. “What I learned was I needed to let go and stop clinging to my technical expertise, and develop a new expertise that focused on management, inspiring teams and managing value for money. It was a change for me to finally say I need to stay here, I need to be the relationship manager, I need to be the defender and mentor of teams instead of I need to do this technical work,” says Ragan. Be flexible to change Complications will likely arise and changes in staffing, security, and activities may be necessary at some point in the project, so chiefs of party should demonstrate adaptability from the start. Learning to become more flexible was one of the most important lessons for Kellum because part of working as a big team means “there are always going to be conflicts and problems arising.” Heuisler agrees that projects also benefit significantly from internal adaptability, as well as strong communications and learning processes. Spend time in the field The COP is like the orchestra conductor says Kellum — indicating areas of need and giving direction for how all the players involved can better harmonize their efforts. However, all too often COPs get stuck in the office, she says, and lose the understanding that comes from spending time in the field. Getting this balance right was a challenge for Kellum while overseeing the project in Haiti and working mainly from Port-au-Prince, where all the meetings were taking place. On reflection, she says she could have spent more time in the field and this is something that is needed more across projects. “It is not just about oversight,” she says “it’s about understanding how things are working, how the team is interpreting the way forward.” For short-term or mid-project COPs: Listen While this is an important skill for any COP, the ability to listen is particularly important for those taking on short-term COP positions or joining a project which is already underway. Every project is different, explains Heuisler, so when assuming a new director role it is essential that you start by listening to existing staff, key partners, and stakeholders before defining next steps. See where you can add value rather than “bulldoze staff with external ideas that sound good on paper or have worked somewhere else,” she says. Try to help staff innovate — this could be in areas such as improving internal systems to save time or money, looking for new programming opportunities, and identifying roadblocks in the day-to-day work to make operations more efficient. Even after a successful start, it is vital that the COP continues to listen throughout the duration of the project to ensure it stays relevant and is able to deliver results, says Heuisler.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"While the exact duties of a COP can vary, this person plays a critical leadership role in the launch and management of a project. Here’s what they said. At the end of the day, every project is only as good as its entire team. If the candidate smiles then I know they are willing to trust me with their lives and future happiness, she says. Communication is key, and better to feel like you are overcommunicating says Ragan, as insufficient communication can lead to confusion, distrust, and wasted resources with stakeholders. Ragan also believes in being authentic with stakeholders and showing them that you are willing to speak honestly. I absolutely want to make a strong case that I have no success without their success, she says, so that I establish a collective commitment to the activity because we both want to succeed. Focus on internal relationships Building relationships internally is also key to success says Kellum, because at the end of the day, every project is only as good as its entire team. I could say ‘no that’s not what they need,’ and make sure the implementers were not just dreaming up something pie in the sky, she explains. Find the balance between technical expertise and people management While the chief of party is ultimately a leadership role, they must also have some understanding of each of the different technical aspects involved the project.","Kate Heuisler, who is currently overseeing USAID’s Development Innovations project in Cambodia, agrees that staff are one of the most critical elements for project success, particularly “the quality and diversity of the people on the team.” The COP is, in a way, the face of the project says Kellum, so a huge part of their role is making sure that all stakeholders — donors, host-nation partners, target beneficiaries, and staff — are involved in the planning and understand they are “part of the vision.” Tasked with overseeing project implementation, the COP is involved in a wide range of activities from hiring staff, to guiding project strategy, to managing financial budgets and donor relationships. Identifying a strong team from the beginning is one of the “critical responsibilities” of a chief of party and something that can make or break the project, says Jane Kellum, an education and gender specialist who was COP for more than two years for a Care project in Haiti. Find the balance between technical expertise and people management While the chief of party is ultimately a leadership role, they must also have some understanding of each of the different technical aspects involved the project. Understand the proposal Kellum had been involved in writing the proposal for the project in Haiti before moving to the chief of party role. --— Jane Kellum, education and gender specialist Ragan also pays attention to a candidate's reaction after she tells them that the scope of work often becomes obsolete within the first five minutes of a job, especially those roles dealing with new approaches and innovation in international development.

52,91710,"What developing countries can learn from India's entrepreneurship ecosystem HYDERABAD, India — India’s largest technology incubator — only 2 years old — is launching its first 90-day accelerator program, thanks to a new Microsoft partnership. The Hyderabad-based T-Hub has already seen hundreds of startups pass through its doors, and plans to welcome the first 10 startups to the new accelerator program in February, connecting those entrepreneurs to new revenue sources and helping them assess shortcomings in their distribution channels, according to T-Hub CEO Jay Krishnan. T-Hub’s quick success and now global reach involving corporates, investors, and academia is just one recent example of India’s leapfrogging entrepreneurial ecosystem. While the vast South Asian country has been seeing an increasing number of startups over the past five years, sectors such as fintech are now growing so rapidly in India that developing and developed nations alike are taking note. Much of today’s digital transformation can be traced to government-led regulation and policy shake-ups under tech-minded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, “whose only agenda is reform,” according to Krishnan, and who launched Startup India in 2016 to boost bank financing and slash taxes for startup ventures. The mobile internet explosion of the past few years paired with affordable data packs from telecom operators has also added fuel to the entrepreneurship fire. To be sure, capital isn’t always readily available, mentorship opportunities remain minimal and access to international markets still poses a challenge. But there are key lessons to be learned from India — namely, the speed and scale at which the nation has adopted complementary tech and policies, and the way decision-makers have leveraged international networks and built layered software platforms with future development in mind from the beginning. India’s transformation is happening at a time when “there is a new, symbiotic relationship between entrepreneurs and the public sector,” Global Entrepreneurship Network President Jonathan Ortmans told the audience at a breakout session during the Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in India’s growing tech capital, nicknamed “Cyberabad.” “It’s not just that [entrepreneurs] are interesting and that startup culture is popular; it’s the fact that as we’ve built up these people in our societies who want to try their hand at something new, they are moving away from the simple work of inventing another app to figure out how to deliver something faster, and they’re moving into the complex world of energy, transportation, health care, and so forth,” Ortmans said. India is a crucial case in point: GES saw Ajaita Shah, who founded her company Frontier Markets to bring solar power to the last mile, emerge as the Grand Champion of the event’s pitch competition out of a pool of 75. The four founders of Indian startup Saathi, meanwhile, are taking on the taboos attached to menstruation throughout the country, as well as addressing environmental concerns, by producing affordable, eco-friendly sanitary pads. A tech-motivated public sector It’s largely government reform that has opened the door to an increasing amount of innovation over the past few years, according to T-Hub’s Krishnan. It was India’s Telangana government, in fact, that spearheaded the creation of T-Hub, then handed the reins to Krishnan. Startup India, launched by Modi in 2016, is also meant to increase the ease of doing business, moving a once lengthy in-person paperwork process online and clarifying what qualifies as a startup. They are changes that Saathi co-founder Tarun Bothra said greatly aided in his own quest to get the sanitary pad startup off the ground, and that Upasana Taku, co-founder of India's largest independent mobile payments network MobiKwik, said could have greatly helped during “the first two or three years where I really stumbled around, just trying to get responses from regulators,” she told Devex of her experience in 2009. But it’s a specific software stack — known as the India Stack — that has garnered international attention and fundamentally changed the way the bottom of the pyramid operates in the country. It began with an ambitious biometric digital identity system called Aadhaar, which assigns a unique number and QR code to every citizen using their photograph, fingerprints, retina scans, and proofs of address. Today, more than 1 billion Indians are registered in this database. The government took it further with an accompanying national payment interface designed as a public good, allowing any bank, payment company, or developer to build on top of it. “In the past, the bottom of pyramid had to wait for actual cash,” Krishnan told Devex as an example. “If I’m a farmer, back in the day — and by that I mean a year ago — I had to wait for the wholesaler to give me cash, and he had to wait to get it from his supplier. Now, I digitally transact with you and that digital piece is as good as cash anywhere in the value chain. I don’t need that paper note in my wallet anymore.” The availability of an open software stack suddenly meant that tech startups could use the framework to develop mobile apps and make services available to a large section of the population instantly — one of several catalysts for India’s “overnight” digital transformation. Modi’s financial inclusion mission can be traced further back — to his internationally lauded Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the flagship financial inclusion drive to expand access to basic savings accounts. One million new bank accounts were opened in a single day, and 300 million have been opened since, according to the PMJDY website. The financial inclusion efforts can also be traced more recently to his controversial and widely criticized attempt to crackdown on illegal wealth by banning high-value currency notes last year. “It was an effort to curb black money and corruption,” Melissa Rakman, who advises global companies on their strategy and investment in India, told Devex. “The secondary goal, which has become the bigger success, is rapidly moving the country toward digital transactions.” The payments piece is what makes India leaps and bounds ahead of other nations, said Rakman, who worked on a project last year with a global impact investor and several consultants to examine the next wave of countries to adopt advanced fintech solutions. “Some of the countries we looked at were in Europe — like Germany — and they are not even doing what India is doing,” she said. Rakman credits some of the progress to a “forward-leaning, tech-comfortable government to create policies that work with the private sector,” but it’s also due to the fact that India already had a strong entrepreneurship ecosystem and pool of well-known founders, both in India and around the world. “That was leverage,” Rakman explained, “A very deep network of companies and technical people that have become champions to move this forward. I think that’s a lesson learned — to leverage your existing strengths of the private sector.” The grassroots-led ecosystem of the future While government-led initiatives can pave the way for innovation, there is still room for entrepreneurs themselves to help create an environment to build and support their ideas. And a more grassroots-led movement is what will launch India’s startups to the masses, several founders at the Global Entrepreneurship told Devex. “We vastly overestimate what the role of government should be,” said Amit Chandra, managing director of global alternative investment firm Bain Capital. “Everyone has this attitude that the government should be the solution provider to every problem.” But entrepreneurs also have a responsibility to create an enabling environment, he said, in order to do more than create shareholder value and “bring society with you” on the journey. By “grassroots,” many speakers at GES referred to the importance of reforming education and building it into the culture from a young age to enforce that it’s OK to take risks, to fail, and to try again. “We need to revamp the education system to promote creative design and critical thinking for kids at a younger age to be tuned to solving problems,” Varun Chandran, chief executive officer of marketing data software company Corporate360, told Devex. “From there, larger innovation will happen.” India Stack and the fintech revolution it has fostered could certainly be seen as a lesson for other countries, but it’s a sticking point for many that an Indian entrepreneur has yet to export a major innovation. Instead, they more often pick up ideas from other countries and adapt them to their own, albeit incredibly diverse, country. “If you look at Ola Cabs, it’s Uber. If you look at Quickr, it’s similar to Craigslist. If you look at Flipkart, it’s Amazon. They’ve just customized them and added some special incentives to make them attractive here,” said Navin Chandra, director for Maventus Software Technologies’ India office. Corporate360’s Chandran stressed the same message, adding that an innovative India tech export will be the ultimate litmus test for the success of the culture the government and entrepreneurs are trying to create. “We need to build out global innovative products from India that are desired by masses all over the world,” Chandran said. “That is the payday for our programs and policies.” Read more Devex coverage on entrepreneurship.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"T-Hub’s quick success and now global reach involving corporates, investors, and academia is just one recent example of India’s leapfrogging entrepreneurial ecosystem.

53,91718,"Oxfam tackles the complicated logistics of its move to Nairobi NAIROBI — The Oxfam International Secretariat has begun a slow move of its headquarters in Oxford, United Kingdom, to Nairobi, Kenya in a complicated process that requires flexibility as the organization navigates issues including delays in work permits, transitioning staff into new roles, and providing various types of employee support, among other challenges. The decision to move was aimed at adapting the organization to the “rapidly changing development landscape,” Adrie Papma, project lead for Oxfam International Secretariat move from Oxford to Nairobi, told Devex. “We want to strengthen the legitimacy of Oxfam’s voice, its accountability and relevance in the south.” The organization had been located in Oxford for over seven decades, since its founding in 1942. Some of the first steps the organization took were to seek out guidance from peer international nongovernmental organizations based in Nairobi, got financial and legal advice and set up an internal project management team for handling the move, covering areas such as logistics. The move will span two years. During that time, as many as 40 roles from offices around the world will move to Kenya. Currently, there are 66 roles in Oxford and around 16 of those roles will move to Nairobi. The Oxfam International Secretariat currently employs approximately 160 people around the world. The roles that were set for relocation to Nairobi were announced more than 18 months ago. Employees notified that their role was moving to Kenya were given a fixed consultation period of three to six months, when they received information about the move, before making their decision. In some cases, relocating staff have received support towards housing and schooling costs. The organization also paired people moving with Oxfam employees who are either local Kenyans or foreign nationals who have lived in Nairobi for several years for guidance on the life move, and set up an internal internet forum for information sharing about living in Nairobi. Working remotely has been made an option to staff, depending on role and location. Staff that have roles considered necessary for Nairobi, but who cannot move because of personal reasons, will be deployed to other positions in Oxfam, where possible. These individuals can be considered for roles in Oxfam Great Britain, whose headquarters are in Oxford, she said. In some cases, temporary staff have been hired in Nairobi when another employee couldn’t yet move for a number of reasons, including their work permit application process, maternity or paternity leave, or other family issues. The organization has worked to be flexible with the move, said Papma. For example, one employee’s wife was due to give birth close to the planned time of the move. Their move was postponed by several months to allow them to enough time to adjust to life with a baby. Oxfam International’s Executive Director Winnie Byanyima will make the official move to Nairobi when her work permit is approved. Her support team in Nairobi, including those working in day-to-day administration, travel planning, managing external meetings, speechwriting and strategy will be in place before her move, Papma said. Staff have been offered salaries within the respective salary scale in Kenya, she said. Oxfam staff already in Kenya have also been impacted. Oxfam Great Britain’s regional centre in Nairobi closed in July 2017. Staff in Nairobi, when possible, have been transitioned into Oxfam International positions. The new headquarters in Nairobi are based in the same building as the former Oxfam Great Britain regional centre. “Managing this has not been easy for all concerned but despite these challenges, colleagues are being patient and flexible,” said Papma. Oxfam has also been hiring new staff locally, regionally, and internationally related to the move. Oxfam is hiring based in the regions where it is most active, training staff on leadership skills, matrix management, and organisational networking. In Nairobi, administration and back office roles have been recruited locally. But there will be no big hiring push during the relocation over the next 2 years. In addition to Oxford and Nairobi, the Oxfam International Secretariat also has offices across the world in Addis Ababa, New York, Washington, D.C., Brussels, and Geneva.

54,91745,"UN's Alston tailors language to talk about development in the US CHARLESTON, West Virginia — Human rights violations and a prevalence of extreme poverty drove the United Nations rapporteur Philip Alston’s recent fact-finding tour across some of the most unequal areas of the United States. But the independent U.N. expert discovered a technical complication to his two-week, cross-country mission, which concluded on Friday. How does one of the world’s pre-eminent international law experts talk about human rights in a country where basic international law tenets — such as the universal right to housing and clean drinking water — are not legally recognized? One tactic was to drop all mention of potentially divisive terms — including human rights — that Alston has routinely used in 25 other country visits since the Human Rights Council appointed him to the part-time, unpaid role in 2014. Instead, Alston’s conversations and meetings in the U.S. — on issues such as homelessness in San Francisco and political rights in Puerto Rico — have revolved around the concept of civil rights. “No one attacks that,” Alston explained to more than 40 civil society members who recently traveled from across West Virginia to a hotel conference room in Charleston, where they shared a complicated web of environmental, health, and economic problems they are working to alleviate. Alston’s specially tailored approach to examining poverty and human rights in the U.S. seemed to pay off, he told Devex on the final leg of his cross-country American journey, speaking at the only free health clinic in Charleston. Los Angeles, Alabama, and Washington, D.C., were also stops on his trip, packed in with government official meetings and tours of struggling neighborhoods. “I haven't had any any abuse so far, which I would have expected. I think in a lot of developed countries, a lot of people would say, 'What the hell is the U.N. doing here? Shouldn't you be in Bangladesh or whatever?'” Alston said. “And I'm always happy to answer those sort of challenges because the whole whole idea of the U.N. Human Rights program is that we cover all countries.” His preliminary findings, released Friday, may still strike a nerve with the Trump administration, which declined to meet with him, Alston said at a Friday afternoon press briefing in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration’s policies on tax reform and health care could worsen the “entrenched poverty” that now divides the U.S., which ranks as the most unequal high-income country, Alston wrote in his report. More than 1 in 8 people in the U.S. — or 40 million people — live in poverty, and almost half of these people, or 18.5 million, live in deep poverty, according to government figures. Poverty in the U.S. can be difficult to quantify, and to consider relatively on a global scale, as a Brookings study found that anywhere from 0 to 15 percent of Americans live on less than $2 a day. Increasingly, though, Americans are faced with health challenges, like high infant and maternal mortality rate relative to other developed countries, more common in lower-middle income and developing countries. Hookworm has resurged in Alabama, Alston noted in his press conference, commenting on the open sewage pools he saw in people’s homes in Montgomery. More than 140 communities in West Virginia also lack access to clean drinking water at home, according to Katherine Garvey, the director of land use and sustainable development law clinic at West Virginia University’s law school. Demands for safe drinking water have ignited a national campaign in India, Alston told Devex, but have not inspired the same pressure on government in West Virginia or Alabama. As the former chair of the U.N. committee on economic, social and cultural rights, Alston — a U.S. resident for the last 20 years — said he debated U.S. officials for “decades, literally,” on acknowledging these rights. The U.S. has not ratified the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, which recognizes the right to social security, adequate standard of living, education, and a high standard of physical and mental health. “And the United States has always been very reluctant to acknowledge that there is any such thing as an economic and social right that resembles a real human right. So my assumption was that there wasn't much point in coming on this particular mission and saying, ‘Well there is a right to health care, there is a right to housing,’” Alston said. “But that is what I would say in any other country, because under international law, there is, and I believe under any sort of decent compact between government and citizens those rights would be assured. But that's not the approach I'm taking here.” In West Virginia, a rural Appalachian state where incomes and quality of life have fallen with the decline of the coal industry, comprehensive health care is considered a luxury for many. About 94 percent of the state’s population is covered by government health insurance, but high payments often still place medical care out of reach. The state also has the highest obesity rate in the nation, with more than 37 percent of the population obese. Last week, Alston, flanked by his three advisers and a group of journalists, briskly made his way through West Virginia Health Right, the capital city’s only free health clinic that operates with private funding and grants. With the help of about 400 volunteer doctors and dentists, the center treats about 21,000 patients a year and also provides adult dental care — not covered by Medicaid, unless in emergency cases. Malav Shaw, a resident dentist who showed Alston the organization’s mobile dental clinic, also described a man in his 30s who arrived with no teeth, just roots in his mouth. “Is Vitamin C the answer?” joked Alston, later going on to praise the efforts of the clinic. Angie Settle, the chief executive officer of the organization, said high demand is pushing Health Right to the verge of having to turn patients away in what she described as the “sickest state” in the U.S. Development work, while clearly underway in the U.S., often takes on a different appearance from what is easily identified in developing countries, says Tony Pipa, a senior fellow on global economy and development at Brookings Institution. He studies how U.S. leadership approaches the Sustainable Development Goals, which call for universal access to health care, among other poverty alleviation, economic and health goals, by 2030. “The U.S. doesn't really do a development plan. If you're in a developing country, you've got a development plan, you're dealing with donors and aid agencies and they're hearing the question all the time: How does this align against the goals?” Pipa said. “It becomes a terminology that's very familiar to both sides — to the government because they're thinking about it in that way and so it's very familiar to civil society.” “I don't think the SDGs provide that yet in the U.S.” Alston, who undertakes two to three country visits per year, first requested to visit the U.S. more than a year ago, under the Obama administration. The State Department extended the invitation, which still stood this year. With visits in the last few years to China, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, Alston intends to cast a wide net, showing that poverty and human rights challenges are at play in all nations. Margaret Chapman Pomponio, the executive director of WV Free, a women’s reproductive health organization, was among the West Virginian civil society actors who seemed surprised, but eager, to welcome a visitor from the U.N. “At first I was surprised. I had gotten an email from the U.N. and then I spoke to them [Alston’s team] ahead of time and it became very clear. It is easy to understand why West Virginia would be selected.

The Trump administration’s policies on tax reform and health care could worsen the entrenched poverty that now divides the U.S., which ranks as the most unequal high-income country, Alston wrote in his report. Poverty in the U.S. can be difficult to quantify, and to consider relatively on a global scale, as a Brookings study found that anywhere from 0 to 15 percent of Americans live on less than $2 a day. The U.S. has not ratified the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, which recognizes the right to social security, adequate standard of living, education, and a high standard of physical and mental health. And the United States has always been very reluctant to acknowledge that there is any such thing as an economic and social right that resembles a real human right. In West Virginia, a rural Appalachian state where incomes and quality of life have fallen with the decline of the coal industry, comprehensive health care is considered a luxury for many. About 94 percent of the state’s population is covered by government health insurance, but high payments often still place medical care out of reach. Pipa said. With visits in the last few years to China, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, Alston intends to cast a wide net, showing that poverty and human rights challenges are at play in all nations.","UN's Alston tailors language to talk about development in the US CHARLESTON, West Virginia — Human rights violations and a prevalence of extreme poverty drove the United Nations rapporteur Philip Alston’s recent fact-finding tour across some of the most unequal areas of the United States. Instead, Alston’s conversations and meetings in the U.S. — on issues such as homelessness in San Francisco and political rights in Puerto Rico — have revolved around the concept of civil rights. More than 140 communities in West Virginia also lack access to clean drinking water at home, according to Katherine Garvey, the director of land use and sustainable development law clinic at West Virginia University’s law school. As the former chair of the U.N. committee on economic, social and cultural rights, Alston — a U.S. resident for the last 20 years — said he debated U.S. officials for “decades, literally,” on acknowledging these rights. Angie Settle, the chief executive officer of the organization, said high demand is pushing Health Right to the verge of having to turn patients away in what she described as the “sickest state” in the U.S. Development work, while clearly underway in the U.S., often takes on a different appearance from what is easily identified in developing countries, says Tony Pipa, a senior fellow on global economy and development at Brookings Institution.

55,91748,"Top employers in agriculture and rural development: A primer Sustainable agriculture and rural development are vital factors in tackling global poverty. The Sustainable Development Goals include eliminating global hunger and achieving food security with sustainable agriculture. But with the global population growing so rapidly, and climate change causing devastation to much agricultural land, achieving this won’t be easy. Until a decade ago, development initiatives were aimed at aiding people out of the agriculture sector and into manufacturing and service sector jobs. However, the 2008 food crisis put agriculture back in the forefront of global development agendas. In 2016, the United States government implemented the Global Food Security Act which was praised by numerous nongovernmental organizations for making food and agriculture a development priority. Poverty in rural areas still remains far above that of urban areas, despite the fact that 80 percent of the food produced across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia comes from smallhold rural farmers. That makes up some 2.5 billion livelihoods. Today, there are many different types of organisations working across the board to contribute to this sector of global development. From research and innovation of new crops to policy making and project implementation on the ground, governments, NGOs, and the private sector alike all have a vested interest in agricultural and rural development. Here is an overview of some of the biggest organizations working in agriculture and rural development. 1. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee As the largest international development nonprofit globally, BRAC employs an impressive 115, 634 employees and have their own university dedicated to development research and learning. They work in 11 countries across Asia and Africa on a variety of poverty reduction initiatives, one of which is their agriculture and food security program. Agriculture in Bangladesh is an important and pressing issue as, every year, land is lost due to natural conditions and disasters while the population also grows by nearly 2 million people. BRAC conducts development research in two centers in Bangladesh to improve crop varieties as well as new agricultural technologies for better yield production. One such example of BRAC’s work is the hybrid variety of rice they developed, which can grow in saline water so that flood-prone land is no longer deemed useless and provides a livelihood for farmers. View some of the global job opportunities open with BRAC here. 2. World Resources Institute The World Resources Institute is a global research organization with around 700 members of staff and experts conducting research into sustainable resource use and management. They use their findings to influence governments, businesses, and civil society and implement their successful programs in other countries and extend them to the global scale where possible. They have six main research goals dedicated to developing methods for people to adopt lifestyles that protect the Earth’s environment. One such goal is “food” and, within it, there are three main priorities: To increase the amount of food produced for the growing global population; to reduce the impacts of agriculture on climate, ecosystems and water; and finally to ensure that the process is socially and economically inclusive. 3. International Fund for Agricultural Development As a specialized agency of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development was founded following the 1970s’ food crisis in order to finance agricultural development projects in developing countries. Their aim is to eradicate rural poverty in developing countries, as three-quarters of the global population’s poorest people live in rural areas, depending on agriculture for their livelihoods. Currently, IFAD has over 600 employees, of which 57% are women, with 100 deployed in 40 different countries. They work with communities throughout Africa, Asia, Latin and Central America, and employ a variety of professional staff, consultants and interns. 4. International Food Policy Research Institute The International Food Policy Research Institute conduct extensive research to provide policy solutions to reducing poverty and ending world hunger and malnutrition in sustainable ways. They have more than 600 employees working in over 50 countries, and is one of several research centers that make up the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research. IFPRI work across Africa, South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean with their headquarters in Washington, D.C., and have six main focus areas: Ensuring sustainable food production, promoting healthy food systems, improving markets and trade, transforming agriculture, building resilience; and strengthening institutions and governance. View current job opportunities with IFPRI here. 5. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations The FAO has 194 member countries and is actively working in over 130 to achieve food security for all. Its key priorities are to eliminate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition; make agriculture, forestry, and fisheries more productive and sustainable; reduce rural poverty; enable inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems; and increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises. With almost 2000 professional staff and a further 1000 support staff, the FAO is one of the largest organizations working on agriculture and rural development. They have staff based both within their headquarters in Rome and spread throughout the rest of the world. The FAO currently have a large number of vacancies worldwide, view them here. 6. The Pacific Community As the scientific and technical organisation of the Pacific region, SPC has three main goals: Create sustainable economic development; to form empowered and resilient communities; and for Pacific people to lead long and healthy lives. With some 200 staff in their New Caledonia headquarters, 300 in their Fiji offices, and an additional two more offices in Asia, they have a large number of employees working across various teams, including the Pacific Agriculture Policy Project. PAPP aims to enhance the Pacific’s capabilities in agricultural work and eradicate poverty through policy development, knowledge support, and smallholder markets. They are currently recruiting consultants and other professionals to work on their agriculture and rural development projects. View their vacancies here. 7. The African Development Bank The AfDB is a regional development bank uniting a large proportion of African countries and donor countries dedicated to sustainable economic and social development in order to reduce poverty across the continent. They work on a wide variety of development initiatives to achieve this, one of which is the “Agriculture and Agro-industries” department which is particularly important because of the dominance of agriculture over most member-countries’ gross domestic product, employment, and economic growth. They aim to empower rural populations by assisting them in improving their productivity and initiating a shift from subsidence to commercial farming. This requires a combination of local knowledge and modern, scientific technologies, which will increase their wealth and quality of life. The AfDB has been in the midst of a large hiring push with many opportunities opening up for staff positions. See some of the positions available and set up alerts to learn about future ones here. 8. Cultivating New Frontiers in Agriculture CNFA is an international nonprofit with over 500 members of staff working in offices across the globe. They have headquarters in Washington, D.C., and Brussels, as well as offices throughout Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, making up a worldwide total of 18 different countries. Their strategy is to educate farmers about market-based techniques and facilitate partnerships with the private sector to cultivate entrepreneurship and stimulate economic growth from the ground up. They employ a broad range of staff, from development experts and short-term consultants, to agronomists and farmers. They also implement the United States International Development Agency “Farmer-to-Farmer” volunteer assignments, and offer a comprehensive internship programme. CNFA are currently recruiting for a number of global positions, view their vacancies here. 9. One Acre Fund One Acre Fund is a social enterprise that uses market-based strategies to assist smallholder farmers and alleviate rural poverty. They provide four main services to rural farmers across sub-Saharan Africa: Asset-based loans of seeds and fertilizers; delivery locations within walking distance of every farmer; training on modern agricultural techniques; and education about market facilitation. From their modest beginnings in 2006 helping 38 families in Kenya, last year alone they reached over 400,000 farmers across six countries and are aiming for 1 million by 2020. One Acre Fund currently have career opportunities across Africa, Asia and the U.S., view them here. 10. Self Help Africa Self Help AFrica is an NGO whose goal is to end hunger and poverty in rural Africa with their expertise in small-scale and family-run farming businesses. As its name suggests, the organization works in nine sub-Saharan countries and employs their own African staff along with local partners to provide assistance to rural communities. They connect smallholder farmers with cooperatives and producers so they have access to markets; tackle gender inequalities within the sector; help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change; educate about food quality; and provide access to microfinances.

56,91750,"Opinion: What post-hurricane Puerto Rico can learn from Africa's race to off-grid solar Months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, 48 percent of the island’s power grid remains offline. Only 75 percent of Puerto Rico is expected to have power by the end of January. The United States territory may have been plunged into darkness since the tropical storm, but it is also now on the radar of solar power providers competing to shape the island’s electrical future. Once reliant on an outdated power grid and imported fossil fuels, Puerto Rico now has an opportunity to build an integrated system of renewable mini grids and backup batteries from scratch. Last month, Tesla began building a solar generation and storage facility in Puerto Rico to power a single hospital, but demand for power outstrips supply. African markets are all too familiar with these conditions, but countries with little power infrastructure are now turning to accessible, more resilient off-grid electricity solutions. Puerto Rico, now an electrical blank canvas, should learn from African markets about cutting ties with fossil fuels, building off-grid from the start, and looking to public-private partnerships for a system-wide rollout. Dependence on imported fossil fuels leaves Puerto Rico vulnerable to unpredictable supply. With the U.S. cutting coal power use by 45 percent in favor of less expensive alternatives like natural gas, Puerto Rico cannot afford its continued reliance on energy sources that are being phased out on the mainland. 1.2 billion people, including 620 million Africans, already live without access to the fossil fuel electrical grid; when a supplying country stops providing fuel to a reliant importer, economic, and social instability are sure to follow. But in-country reliance on fossil fuel pipelines can also pose challenges: Nigeria lost $8.4 billion in revenue when a rebel group in the Niger Delta attacked the country’s pipelines in 2016. Greater reliance on renewables can alleviate these anxieties. Countries such as Cape Verde are leading the way in the region, by pledging to be 100% renewable by 2025. Thanks in large part to Chinese imports, solar PV panels are cheaper than ever: With prices falling 80 percent between 2010 and 2015, solar is set to become the most cost-effective energy source over the next decade. With more sunshine than states such as California, Puerto Rico is in a position to end its relationship with dirty power and develop an independent energy strategy. Where renewable sources are abundant, governments should build integrated mini grids from the start. Industrialized countries such as Iceland and Norway get nearly all of their electricity from renewable sources, but African markets are following suit. Mini grids, which operate at a fraction of the scale of utility systems, are transforming villages from Tanzania to Equatorial Guinea. These modular power systems are expected to bring power to 120 million people in African regions without electricity. Puerto Rico, at this critical point, should emulate countries that have adopted mini grid systems rather than a single, utility-scale platform. Utility-scale projects are expensive and require a long time investment to complete, making this a prohibitive option for post-hurricane Puerto Rico. Avoiding reliance on one main power provider, such as scandal-ridden Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority — which was going bankrupt prior to the disaster — could improve resilience during future hurricane seasons and help rollout electricity across the island, particularly in hard-to-reach places already off the grid. In African countries, the majority of the solar investments are funded or backed by multilateral organisations as government subsidies dwindle. Egypt, for example, has attracted $1.8 billion in solar investment, with major investments coming from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. Italy’s Enel is investing $120 million in an partnership with the Ethiopian government to build a 100 megawatts solar farm, and developing a solar and wind power microgrid for 100 villages in western Kenya. South Africa has one of the most developed regulatory frameworks, the South African Renewable Programme, whose clarity and predictability have helped the country retain its status as one of one of the world’s most promising renewable energy markets. However, Africa’s most pressing challenge executing renewable power projects is an irregular regulatory framework that discourages investment. Like energy-starved Africa, Puerto Rico can be a model for green growth by trading vulnerable centralized electrical grids for cost-effective, modular, off-grid systems. Rather than waiting for an outmoded and overdue energy intervention from the mainland, Puerto Rico should look to the African markets launching sustainable mini grid systems backed by public-private partnerships. Restoring Puerto Rico’s power systems to their prehurricane state does a disservice to the people and leaves the island vulnerable to the next natural disaster. But a forward-looking Puerto Rico will let go of the grid as it was and embrace proposals by renewable energy providers who see the future as it should be.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"African markets are all too familiar with these conditions, but countries with little power infrastructure are now turning to accessible, more resilient off-grid electricity solutions.

57,91775,"How Trump's first year impacted developing countries WASHINGTON — The policies and budgets debated and decided in the halls Congress and within the walls of the White House in the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency are already having an impact on mothers, farmers, and children around the world. As the U.S. government continues to operate under temporary funding bills, some organizations are feeling cuts already, or seeing the impact of a system moving slowly amid great uncertainty. From mothers in Kenya, to farmers in Malawi and Tajikistan, it seems that the most immediate impacts are being felt in health and in agriculture, where policy shifts have accompanied the budget uncertainty. The impacts, while immediate for some now, are expected to multiply in the year ahead, and if the current pattern of delaying contracts or only doing short-term, almost stop-gap programming continues, many experts believe long-term development gains are at risk. Devex spoke with a number of government officials, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, and U.S. Agency for International Development contractors about how the budget recommendations and policies coming through Washington are impacting people in developing countries. The picture they paint is one filled with apprehension, disruption, and the potential to reverse or limit gains and effectiveness. Delays and inefficiency While many of the proposed funding cuts haven’t come through, continued budget and policy uncertainty has resulted in canceled or reduced contracts and delayed programs, which is limiting effectiveness on the ground, according to conversations with USAID implementers and a letter from Interaction, an alliance of U.S.-based NGOs. Interaction, on behalf of its members, recently wrote a letter to USAID’s acting assistant administrator for the Bureau for Management to express concern about cancellations or reductions in USAID programs around the world due to budget uncertainty. “The ability to deliver life-saving and life-altering assistance is paramount to our community and USAID’s curtailing of programs, that include support for food and nutrition assistance, the education of young children, the treatment of contagious diseases, democracy and good governance, among other areas, comes at a time of outstanding need,” the letter states. Interaction has tracked more than two dozen examples of USAID withholding hundreds of millions of dollars that had been appropriated as part of the fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 budgets. The letter highlights several examples, including a nutrition project in Africa that has been delayed more than a year, and a program in Asia that can’t procure commodities, which may disrupt the food pipeline early in fiscal year 2018. Nine democracy, human rights, and governance programs at USAID or the State Department were canceled or delayed, often without explanation despite funding having been previously allocated. “It is our hope that USAID is able to address these issues expeditiously so that critical programming can continue,” the letter reads. “While we understand USAID is immersed in the redesign of U.S. foreign assistance, the agency must preserve current programming at proper funding levels as it realigns itself for the future.” A senior staff member at a USAID contractor described “terrible, tremendous delays in procurements, the release of RFPS,” in an interview with Devex. She asked not to be identified in order to speak freely. The delays seem to vary by mission, with some, such as Kenya and Serbia, pushing things through to get things contracted ahead of future cuts and others, such as Nigeria delaying contracts for more than a year, she said. The U.S. government made some changes to Feed the Future, the flagship food security program, reducing the number of countries where it would be active, in a process that still seems unclear to some who are implementing the program. Feed the Future countries would follow a strategy set through the program, and now, in some cases, those that were dropped from the program are not confined by that strategy and are defining country needs differently, the contractor said. Tajikistan, for example, was dropped from Feed the Future and in October the mission put out an export-oriented agribusiness competitiveness activity, which was outside the Feed the Future technical area, she said. Feed the Future funds came directly from D.C. and didn’t have to be part of mission budgets, which freed up missions to use the funding for other things and rely on the Feed the Future funds to cover agriculture-related programs. “Missions now are able to design a project that’s a little more of a holistic fit for the portfolio, or the country, but there is no dedicated stream of funding. They have to find it in mission funding,” she said. The changes and budget uncertainty is also disrupting projects. A Feed the Future project in Malawi, for example, got less than half of the funding it should have for year two of the five-year project. Essentially, that funding will fund operations but what the project can do in its second year is “dramatically reduced,” she said. That is detrimental, not only because it means inactivity for likely at least one planting season and the most vulnerable farmers won’t get support, but also because they will lose trust in the community and the program will be less effective, the contractor said. When programs are sent into a holding pattern, they lose momentum and even if there is a future influx of funding, it takes money to restart the project and is not as effective. Reproductive and maternal health Perhaps the most immediate impacts of Trump administration policy are being felt as the result of the expanded “global gag rule,” or Mexico City Policy, which prohibits foreign NGOs that receive U.S. aid for global health programming to provide any abortion-related services, including referrals or counseling. “Policies like the global gag rule will really undermine health systems,” he said. “It will be a spiral effect that takes us backwards in time, takes us back years of great work in global health.” --— Jonathan Rucks, advocacy director, PAI The result has been that organizations providing reproductive health care and other services have had their U.S. funding cut, or they’ve been forced to turn down U.S. funding to continue educating women about all of their options. Bernard Olayo, the founder of Center for Public Health and Development in Kenya, has already seen organizations and health clinics lay off staff, and there is already more pressure on public facilities and public resources to try to meet those needs, he said. While Olayo’s work hasn’t been impacted directly by the global gag rule, many of the organizations he works with are facing major cuts in funding for critical health programs, which they “expect will directly impact the lives of many women and children.” In addition to the organizations that will have their funding cut, USAID missions stopped or delayed much of their family planning and broader global health funding, said Jonathan Rucks, the advocacy director for PAI, a global organization working on reproductive health. “Policies like the global gag rule will really undermine health systems,” he said. “It will be a spiral effect that takes us backwards in time, takes us back years of great work in global health.” In Mozambique and Madagascar, programs that are working to help hard-to-reach women and girls will come to an end because there are no partners yet to take them on, Rucks said. In some cases PAI is working to see if other organizations in the area could ensure that the women and girls continue to have access to health care, he added. Rucks said that while the early impacts are evident today, when the policy is fully implemented next year, they will be even greater. The funding cuts and budget uncertainty have also sent a bad signal about U.S. leadership in global health and to country governments where U.S. funding has been used as leverage to get them to invest in health care needs, including reproductive health, Rucks said. U.S. funding for global health programs is critical, and outstrips what other countries put in, Olayo said. Even if countries try to fill the gap with domestic resources or support from other funders, that will take time. “The biggest worry for most people is that many that should have received services will not be able to receive them,” Olayo said. In some cases the expected cuts have spurred governments to think about how they might bridge a gap or shortfall. Uganda, for example, expects a “major shortfall” in family planning commodities in the next two years and the government is in discussions with other partners to try to meet the need, Olayo said. Still, there are concerns that there will be disruption and shortages in reproductive health commodities. Spurring a push for domestic resource mobilization The effort to get countries to improve their own systems and better fund services for their citizens is not a new one, but the U.S. funding cuts seem to be actively forcing some governments to think more seriously about how they will do so in the wake of aid shortfalls. “Everybody wants governments to take on ownership of these programs but it really is a long-term plan. It can’t happen between one fiscal year and another. It’s not like flipping a light switch.” --— Jonathan Rucks, advocacy director, PAI The U.S. is the largest global health donor, and many countries are dependent on U.S. funds to run national health programs and tackle key diseases including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. “It’s an opportunity for countries to start thinking about how they can start co-funding, even if donor money supports some critical care services,” Olayo said. In Kenya, for example, the government now has a plan to use its own resources to fund reproductive health programs, he said, and more middle-income countries should be looking for ways to pay for more of health costs. But while growing or middle-income countries may be able to cover more of the costs, the poorest countries will likely continue to suffer, Olayo said. “Everybody wants governments to take on ownership of these programs but it really is a long-term plan. It can’t happen between one fiscal year and another. It’s not like flipping a light switch,” Rucks said. For countries, such as Ethiopia, where nearly half the health budget is donor-funded, cuts could disrupt entire health systems, Rucks said. But generally the era of relying so heavily on U.S. funding for critical global health needs may be coming to an end and countries are more focused on how they can meet existing policies or strategies once U.S. funding is cut, said Ngozi Erondu, an assistant professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-founder of the Global Bridge Group, LLC, a global health consultancy, who works with policymakers in 14 sub-Saharan African countries on health systems and malaria. “I definitely think that it is a good thing that local governments are thinking about how they can uphold their own systems. It’s something the global community has been talking about a long time,” Erondu said. But she warned there is confusion about how to do so and a concern that the health systems of some countries would be left in shambles after a U.S. withdrawal. There are certainly some cases where countries just couldn’t come up with the funds to keep programs running that are supported by U.S. dollars, but in others, it might help leaders become more accountable, a Nigerian government official, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely, told Devex. In some cases, aid money makes countries less accountable to its people, but when aid budgets are cut and care is lost, citizens begin to question the government, he said. These cuts could be an opportunity to get governments to commit more resources, some that have been subsumed by fraud, to programs, he said. “These governments, now starved of money, need be able solve societal problems, provide solutions — that’s a good thing,” the official said. In Nigeria, for example, the government will need to procure HIV medications because the U.S. has withdrawn assistance, as well as some TB drugs, which are very expensive, the official said. While it has committed to doing so, he doesn’t know if the government will in fact be able to procure what it said it will procure. “There is a lot of apprehension and tension in ministries,” the official said. “I just hope politicians come through and provide these things. If not, people will be in trouble.” If countries fall short — because they just don’t have the funds or don’t have the purchasing power — they will look to other partners to help bridge the gaps and build alliances with, he said. Influence and allies One impact that’s perhaps a bit more difficult to define is the decline of American influence in developing countries. A number of development professionals and grassroots NGO leaders told Devex that perceptions of the U.S. are changing. In some cases, that means that local communities see Trump’s tweets and are reluctant to support American businesses trying to enter their communities. In other cases, it’s leading to a sense that the U.S. may not be the leader it once was, and countries may not be as readily influenced by policy recommendations, especially as they turn to other countries to meet shortfalls left by the U.S. retreat. One potential sign that U.S. influence is already diminishing came Thursday, when the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to denounce the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, despite threats by President Trump to cut aid to countries that voted against the U.S. decision. “For a long time the power of the U.S. was not just felt within the developing world, in places like Kenya, through the military and other things, but through the charitable arm of the U.S. government,” Olayo said. People are hearing the America First rhetoric and it is reducing U.S. influence, he said. “People don’t feel that the U.S. cares. That feeling that they care or will support the countries in need is reducing,” he said. Aid is a foreign policy tool, and governments will listen to countries that provide aid, and cooperate with them on security and economic issues, the Nigerian government official told Devex. When the U.S. cuts aid, it loses the leverage that it has with leaders to support their causes, he said. Among the leaders, often doctors and those working in health ministries, who Erondu speaks to, there has been a “solemn acceptance” of the situation, but also a shift in perception of the U.S. A “realization that the U.S. is not as powerful, or bulletproof as they thought” because in some ways the U.S. under Trump’s leadership is more like them, Erondu said. It’s too early to tell if actual influence has changed, but there is less confidence now that the U.S. will do what it says it will do, she said. PAI is also concerned that governments won’t take the advocacy community seriously as a result of the back and forth about funding in the U.S. government, Rucks said. “Part of our ability to have strong conversations and influence with governments is the fact that we’re bringing something to the table,” he said. Without being able to bring technical expertise and funding to support change, it makes it harder to advocate for governments to act, Rucks added. As the U.S. withdraws, countries will look elsewhere for support and will form new alliances, several people told Devex. That may mean working more with the U.K. or European aid agencies, but it will also mean looking east to Japan, and certainly to China.

Delays and inefficiency While many of the proposed funding cuts haven’t come through, continued budget and policy uncertainty has resulted in canceled or reduced contracts and delayed programs, which is limiting effectiveness on the ground, according to conversations with USAID implementers and a letter from Interaction, an alliance of U.S.-based NGOs. It is our hope that USAID is able to address these issues expeditiously so that critical programming can continue, the letter reads. Policies like the global gag rule will really undermine health systems, he said. It will be a spiral effect that takes us backwards in time, takes us back years of great work in global health. While Olayo’s work hasn’t been impacted directly by the global gag rule, many of the organizations he works with are facing major cuts in funding for critical health programs, which they expect will directly impact the lives of many women and children. In addition to the organizations that will have their funding cut, USAID missions stopped or delayed much of their family planning and broader global health funding, said Jonathan Rucks, the advocacy director for PAI, a global organization working on reproductive health. Uganda, for example, expects a major shortfall in family planning commodities in the next two years and the government is in discussions with other partners to try to meet the need, Olayo said. It can’t happen between one fiscal year and another. It’s not like flipping a light switch, Rucks said.","The funding cuts and budget uncertainty have also sent a bad signal about U.S. leadership in global health and to country governments where U.S. funding has been used as leverage to get them to invest in health care needs, including reproductive health, Rucks said. But generally the era of relying so heavily on U.S. funding for critical global health needs may be coming to an end and countries are more focused on how they can meet existing policies or strategies once U.S. funding is cut, said Ngozi Erondu, an assistant professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-founder of the Global Bridge Group, LLC, a global health consultancy, who works with policymakers in 14 sub-Saharan African countries on health systems and malaria. --— Jonathan Rucks, advocacy director, PAI The U.S. is the largest global health donor, and many countries are dependent on U.S. funds to run national health programs and tackle key diseases including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The result has been that organizations providing reproductive health care and other services have had their U.S. funding cut, or they’ve been forced to turn down U.S. funding to continue educating women about all of their options. There are certainly some cases where countries just couldn’t come up with the funds to keep programs running that are supported by U.S. dollars, but in others, it might help leaders become more accountable, a Nigerian government official, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely, told Devex. Perhaps the most immediate impacts of Trump administration policy are being felt as the result of the expanded “global gag rule,” or Mexico City Policy, which prohibits foreign NGOs that receive U.S. aid for global health programming to provide any abortion-related services, including referrals or counseling. In other cases, it’s leading to a sense that the U.S. may not be the leader it once was, and countries may not be as readily influenced by policy recommendations, especially as they turn to other countries to meet shortfalls left by the U.S. retreat. In addition to the organizations that will have their funding cut, USAID missions stopped or delayed much of their family planning and broader global health funding, said Jonathan Rucks, the advocacy director for PAI, a global organization working on reproductive health.

The effort to get countries to improve their own systems and better fund services for their citizens is not a new one, but the U.S. funding cuts seem to be actively forcing some governments to think more seriously about how they will do so in the wake of aid shortfalls.",0
58,91778,"What the US National Security Strategy says about global development WASHINGTON — The new United States National Security Strategy, released Monday, outlines a U.S.-centric development policy that prioritizes working with countries aligned with U.S. interests, calls for countering China’s influence, views development as a tool for U.S. security and puts private sector activity at the fore. The strategy puts in writing what U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green has been saying in speeches since he took the position: That “the purpose of U.S. foreign assistance should be to end the need for it,” that U.S. foreign assistance will not promote dependency, and that it will prioritize working with countries, or “aspiring partners” as it puts it, that are aligned with U.S. interests. “U.S. development assistance must support America’s national interests,” the strategy document says. “The United States will promote a development model that partners with countries that want progress, consistent with their culture, based on free market principles, fair and reciprocal trade, private sector activity, and rule of law,” it reads. “We will emphasize reforms that unlock the economic potential of citizens, such as the promotion of formal property rights, entrepreneurial reforms, and infrastructure improvements — projects that help people earn their livelihood and have the added benefit of helping U.S. businesses.” The policy states that the U.S. expects other nations to share responsibility, but says that it will remain “a generous nation.” Here’s a look at what the new strategy says about some key development issues. A focus on the private sector and economic growth The U.S. can play a “catalytic role in promoting private sector-led economic growth,” to create future partners in trade and security. The strategy points to the Marshall Plan and U.S. support in South Korea and Japan as examples of where U.S. aid effectively helped countries build their economies and become key markets for U.S. goods and strategic allies, and suggests using that as a model for effective foreign assistance. “Some of the greatest triumphs of American statecraft resulted from helping fragile and developing countries become successful societies,” the strategy says. The U.S. will mobilize public and private resources to maximize returns and outcomes, the policy says, while also reducing the “burden” on government resources. “American-led investments represent the most sustainable and responsible approach to development and offer a stark contrast to the corrupt, opaque, exploitive, and low-quality deals offered by authoritarian states,” the policy states. Competing with China The strategy makes clear that this administration, like the last, sees China as a considerable threat, and that foreign aid will be used in part to counter China’s push for global influence. “Today, the United States must compete for positive relationships around the world. China and Russia target their investments in the developing world to expand influence and gain competitive advantages against the United States,” the strategy reads. It goes on to say that China is investing billions in infrastructure around the world and that the U.S. “provides an alternative to state-directed investments, which often leave developing countries worse off.” The policy highlights China’s role in Africa, where it has expanded its economic and military presence to become the continent’s largest trading partner, according to the strategy. “Some Chinese practices undermine Africa’s long-term development by corrupting elites, dominating extractive industries, and locking countries into unsustainable and opaque debts and commitments,” the strategy says. The U.S. seeks economic ties for market access and to create lasting relationships around common political and security concerns, and would like to see African nations integrated into the world economy, that can provide for their citizens, and manage security threats. Development finance As the administration has already announced, it is committed to modernizing its development finance tools. In this strategy, it says the motivation is “so that U.S. companies have incentives to capitalize on opportunities in developing countries.” Development finance will also be used as a tool to make the U.S. competitive with other countries for global influence, and remove any obstacles for U.S. companies wanting to do business in the developing world. Ray Washburne, the chief executive officer of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. development finance institution released a statement alongside the strategy saying that it “rightly recognizes the power of mobilizing private capital in advancing our foreign policy and enhancing American influence” and that the agency looks forward to working with others in government to create a stronger, more modern development finance institution. Fragile states While many countries around the world have increased their focus on fragile states and made commitments to put certain percentages of their development dollars towards them, the strategy said that the U.S. will commit selectively. “We will give priority to strengthening states where state weaknesses or failure would magnify threats to the American homeland,” the strategy says. The U.S. will prioritize programs where weak countries would create bigger threats to the U.S., such as Afghanistan. The U.S. will also focus on working with reform-minded governments, people, and civil society, according to the policy, and work to ensure that there are lasting solutions, increased accountability, and a reduction of costs. Multilateral engagement The U.S. will continue to engage in multilateral forums and arrangements that affect U.S. interests to maintain influence and protect American values, the strategy says. “If the United States cedes leadership of these bodies to adversaries, opportunities to shape developments that are positive for the United States will be lost,” the policy said. “Where existing institutions and rules need modernizing, the United States will lead to update them.” The U.S. will work to reform the United Nations, will require accountability, and emphasize that responsibility is shared among members. “If the United States is asked to provide a disproportionate level of support for an institution, we will expect a commensurate degree of influence over the direction and efforts of that institution.” The U.S. will also continue to play a leadership role at the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, but will also seek reforms at those institutions. The U.S. will encourage multilateral development banks to focus on in high-quality infrastructure projects that promote economic growth. Technology, internet, innovation The U.S. government will incorporate innovative technologies into its development programs and work to protect a free and open internet. The U.S. will look to digital technologies that can enable people to access financial services, reduce corruption, and improve transparency. And it will work with organizations, including the U.N. and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to promote “the free flow of data” and ensure that there are minimal barriers to “the global exchange of information and services.” Governance and democracy The U.S. will use its influence to encourage countries to improve governance and the rule of law. The strategy highlights the Millenium Challenge Corporation, which it says is already embracing that idea as it selects countries based on commitments to reform and then monitors and evaluate progress to those commitments. Human rights, women’s rights, religious freedom The U.S. will support those living under oppressive regimes and may use diplomatic sanctions or other tools to isolate states and leaders who don’t follow U.S. values. “We will not remain silent in the face of evil,” the strategy states, adding that the U.S. will hold perpetrators of genocides and mass atrocities to account. The U.S. will also work to empower women and youth, who are key to creating prosperous successful societies. It will support programs that work to advance women’s equality and protect the rights of women and girls, as well as religious minorities. Humanitarian assistance The U.S. will continue its leadership in humanitarian assistance, according to the strategy, but will also expect other countries to step up. As part of its humanitarian response, the U.S. will continue to respond to manmade and natural disasters. It will also support food security and health programs that address the root causes of hunger and disease. The U.S. will also support displaced people “close to their homes” to help meet their needs until they can return home. Global health security The policy outlines that the U.S. will work with countries to detect and mitigate disease outbreaks early to prevent the spread of disease and will “encourage other countries to invest in basic health care systems.” The U.S. will also work to protect the intellectual property of biomedical innovation and focus on improving emergency response and coordination systems domestically. Climate The strategy makes clear that the U.S. will continue to advocate for the use of fossil fuels as part of the world’s energy mix. “U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an antigrowth energy agenda” the policy states, going on to say that “much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.” While that acknowledgment may have been welcome several years ago, some of the largest developing countries are turning away from fossil fuels. The administration will work to protect the global energy infrastructure, improve the American technological edge in energy — from nuclear technology to better batteries and carbon-capture technologies. It will also seek to “ensure universal access to affordable, reliable energy, including highly efficient fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables, to help reduce poverty, foster economic growth, and promote prosperity.” What's the future of U.S. aid and development policy under the Trump administration?

59,91784,"Philippines withdraws from MCC, citing Marawi crisis as a priority MANILA — The Philippine government announced Tuesday it is no longer pursuing its current second compact application with the Millennium Challenge Corp. on the same day the donor’s board of directors are set to meet to discuss countries for compact selection and reselection. Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. made the announcement during a press briefing in Malacanang, where he also talked about the details of the government’s newly signed tax reforms. The decision, he said, was made by President Rodrigo Duterte’s economic team, and “primarily” by Department for Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano. “It was deemed that for the time being, we will withdraw our application for the second cycle and we will focus instead on the rebuilding of Marawi,” Roque said, referring to a province in the south of the country hit by civil unrest. He noted, however, that the Philippine government has “invited” the U.S. government to support and assist them on Marawi’s reconstruction. Marawi, a province in Mindanao, has been hit by strife for months as Philippine government forces battle groups alleged to be affiliated with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The conflict, known as the Marawi crisis, caused widespread destruction in the province and has driven many people from their home. Thousands of buildings were destroyed in the heavy fighting. “We will probably apply again some other time. But for now, our resources, attention, and energies are focused on the rebuilding of Marawi, and for obvious reasons,” Roque said. The Philippine government’s decision comes a year after the MCC deferred its decision on whether to allow the Philippines to continue developing its second compact. The compact, MCC said in Dec. 2016, “is subject to a further review of concerns around rule of law and civil liberties,” which many assumed was a reference to rising international concerns on the Duterte administration’s deadly “war on drugs” campaign. Last year, Devex sources close to the compact development process were still hopeful the compact would push through, unless the MCC decided otherwise. The MCC was supposed to make a decision in March 2017, but had not given any new updates. MCC is well-known for its strict ground rules regarding compact country selection and the disbursement of aid, and it has a history of suspending or terminating assistance to countries with governance issues. The presidential spokesperson denied that the Philippine decision was in any way influenced by factors such as any potential U.S. interference in domestic affairs. “Not at all. Not this instance. It was really just that Marawi happened. We did not expect it and it’s going to be very costly rebuilding,” he said, explaining that while the MCC compact would provide the Philippines additional financing resources for its development projects, it usually comes with a cost for the recipient government as well. “We have to earmark funds also because these are projects with counterpart funds and of course, this will also focus on previously identified projects,” the spokesperson said. “And we have decided that our resources and our priority will be the rebuilding of Marawi for the time being.” He doesn’t think the rebuilding of Marawi qualifies under the MCC rules and priorities. MCC’s compact priorities are in the sectors of agriculture, education, energy, health, land and property rights, roads and transportation, and water, sanitation, and irrigation. The Philippines’ first compact with MCC, which ended in May 2016, was focused on road rehabilitation, better tax collection, and a program aimed at improving public service delivery of poverty-reduction programs at community level. The second compact was expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2017, and in initial Devex discussions with the local compact team, was supposed to cover more than $400 million, roughly the same amount as the first compact. One of the areas being considered for investment in the second compact was in the area of rural agriculture. “We are confident that the U.S. government fully understands the decision to reallocate our funding priority for this year and that this will not, in any way, adversely impact our eligibility for another round of compact assistance in the future,” Roque said.

60,91787,"Webinar: 7 tips for building a better response to sexual assault Across the development industry, organizations are rethinking their policies for responding to — and preventing — sexual harassment and assault at work. In the wake of #MeToo — and now #AidToo — United Nations agencies, former government officials and international NGOs are shining a light on a problem endemic to the development and humanitarian community. Just as importantly, they are also shining a light on the solutions. Devex’s careers and recruiting expert Kate Warren spoke with KonTerrra Group’s Lead Consulting Psychologist Kavita Avula and human rights lawyer Megan Nobert about which policies work — and which don’t — for preventing and responding to sexual violence. Their advice is below, and you can view the full webinar here. 1. Start with recruitment. Complete thorough background and reference checks for your potential employees. If possible, check in informally with your network of human resources professional. If you’re contacted for a background check, make sure you share any information that you have on perpetrators of sexual violence. In your hiring contracts, include a section that outlines how your organization will disclose any complaints to future employers. 2. Have a clear sexual violence policy that is updated regularly. Outline a zero tolerance policy for sexual violence. Make sure you have all of the information your employees need — from a commitment to a workplace free of sexual violence to what the reporting process entails. For cross-cultural contexts, it’s particularly important to include examples of inappropriate behavior. Go the extra step to ensure it’s both easily readable and actionable. It’s also important to include protection against retaliation in your policy — and enforce it. A team of leaders or a task force should review your policy at least once a year. 3. Follow through on your policy’s promises. Take reports seriously. Regardless of who it comes from — whether it’s another employee, someone from a different organization, or someone from the community — any allegation should be taken seriously and investigated swiftly and thoroughly. The result of each allegation will vary depending on the act, but be prepared to take action. This may include expelling perpetrators from your organization. 4. Train staff well — and often — for the roles they may take on within your process. All staff members should receive training about sexual violence policies, starting with onboarding. But don’t stop there. Frequently revisit it with your employees so everyone understands how to report — and what happens if they are the ones reported. Offer specialized trainings for those receiving and investigating reports. Ensure management and human resource professionals have a deep understanding of the policies, procedures and resources — and how to sensitively communicate with survivors. The specialized training should reach everyone from headquarters to country offices. Training can also be preventative. Bystander training in particular creates a sense of collective responsibility. It equips the employees with a range of options they can use to say something if they see something. 5. Ensure survivors feel supported. Offer multiple reporting channels for people who need to report sexual harassment or assault, such as a phone number, email address, and person. Those responding to the reported crimes should acknowledge that it is difficult to come forward, and approach the situation with a welcoming and private environment. This includes understanding how to avoid shaming, recognizing signs of trauma and triggering, and knowing how to warmly transfer the survivor to other resources. Be clear and upfront about your responsibilities. You should alert the survivor if you are required to tell someone else, so there are no surprises down the road. Every action — from counseling to filing a report — should be voluntary for the survivor. If the survivor does not want to investigate, leave the option of doing so down the road open. Start a file on the alleged perpetrator, in case anything comes up in the future. 6. Think proactively about medical and psychological response. Medical care should be discussed in safety and security planning. Think about where medications to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections will come from, in addition to where a survivor should be taken if medical attention is needed. Ideally, the survivor should also receive psychological support. In areas where this may not be possible in-person, remote counseling and telehealth services — such as video therapy — could be a viable option. 7. Create a culture that does not tolerate sexual violence. Policies can be meaningless unless brought to life by the people in your organization. So, it’s important to not just have a policy, but to socialize it among the employees. They should feel bound to it — and responsible for upholding it. This begins with leadership. From the beginning, set a firm tone that sexual violence will not be tolerated in any form from anyone. Facilitate ongoing conversations about the topic to demonstrate your commitment to zero tolerance.

61,91789,"A new class of UN leaders takes the helm UNITED NATIONS — It’s been nearly a year since António Guterres assumed his post as the leader of the United Nations. The former head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees took on the unenviable task of revamping an organization fractured by public relations challenges, from the U.N.’s role in bringing cholera in Haiti, to U.N. peacekeepers assaulting the people they are designated to protect. Guterres, meanwhile, was also tasked with looking outward at a record number of protracted humanitarian crises. The secretary-general launched plans for bold change. There was the initial pledge to finally make good on the U.N.’s promise of reaching gender parity — and a series of high-level appointments of women, such as Amina Mohammed as his deputy secretary-general. And, then, U.N. reform, a tiered process to reconstruct a complex, dated system that Guterres’ team said would become more effective and coordinated. U.N. reform is well underway, and U.N. agencies are working toward the goal of hiring equal numbers of women, at all levels, by 2030. Pressure from the new U.S. administration and the threat of funding cuts likely only provided further stress as the U.N. responded to a record-setting number of people requiring humanitarian assistance from Yemen, to Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Somalia. Next year, more funding than ever — approximately $22.5 billion — will be required to respond to the needs of 135 million people. These efforts are being led by a new roster of leaders at the U.N. agencies, some of whom are already on board and others who will be announced in the new year. The United Nations Children’s Fund has yet to announce its new executive director and successor to Anthony Lake, and the U.N. will also be in search of a new human rights chief, as Zeid Ra'ad Hussein said this week that he will not seek a second term because of the “current geopolitical context.” Here’s a look at the new class of U.N. leaders and what they might be up against in 2018. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom made history in 2017 when he became the first African to lead the WHO and the first director-general to be elected in a process involving the full World Health Assembly. The WHO director-general enjoys wide support across the global health spectrum, including within his own organization. In Tedros’ first few months in office, he’s followed through on his campaign pledge and satisfied calls for more women in WHO leadership roles. He’s started to drive a cultural change within his organization by initiating engagement with staff and encouraging his directors to do the same. He’s also set-up a council that meets every two weeks to ensure the WHO is on top of every public health emergency taking place across the globe. Tedros believes his role is not only to secure support for WHO, but to advocate for all organizations working in global health. He’s been to high-profile meetings, such as the G-20 in Hamburg, Germany, to drum up support for universal health coverage, and has met with world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin during the first WHO Global Ministerial Conference to end tuberculosis in Moscow in November. Currently, one of his biggest challenges is winning member states’ support for his draft 13th General Program of Work. This includes proposals for the WHO to achieve a “triple billion target” — making 1 billion people safer in emergencies, giving 1 billion people health coverage, and improving the healthy lives of 1 billion people. During a special session in November, some member states voiced questions and concerns on these ambitious targets. The next official discussion on the draft program of work will be in January 2018. David Beasley: executive director of the World Food Programme When David Beasley was named executive director of the World Food Programme in March, it may have come as a bit of surprise, as the former South Carolina governor was little known to the development community. Some development observers and member states had also advocated for a more open process in selecting key leadership positions at top U.N. agencies in 2017. Beasley — who is well-connected to the Trump administration — has proven to be an outspoken advocate for both continued and increased U.S. contributions to the WFP and to addressing hunger and food security globally. He has testified in Congress, met with U.S. policymakers, and used the media to call attention to crises from Yemen to the Democratic Republic of Congo. His tenure has not been without some controversy. Beasley has linked food aid to national security, calling it the “first line of offense and defense against extremism and terrorism,” which has worried some in the development community. Some were also concerned that his links to the White House would be problematic, but he has not always toed the line or followed the lead of the Trump administration. Beasley has repeatedly called on Saudi Arabia to step up as a donor, particularly in Yemen, where Beasley has said the country should fully fund the humanitarian relief efforts, which are needed as a result of a conflict that the Saudis are directly involved in. Beasley did not step in at an easy time, with four countries on the brink of famine, and a growing number of humanitarian crises with rising food insecurity. Many of those crises will continue in the year ahead and will continue to test Beasley’s leadership, particularly in the face of what are now considerable funding shortfalls. Achim Steiner: administrator of the United Nations Development Programme Achim Steiner is no U.N. novice. The 56-year-old Brazilian native, who was raised by German parents, spent a decade running the U.N. Environment Programme until 2016. Appointed by the UNDP executive board to run one of the U.N.’s largest agencies in April, Steiner told Devex in a recent interview that he sometimes reflects on the sheer size difference of the two agencies as he considers what’s at stake with his new job. Leading nearly 17,000 staff in 170 countries, Steiner will oversee a new strategic plan for UNDP, which will launch in 2018 and guide the agencies work through 2021. The plan has parallels to Guterres’ reform strategy — prioritizing “future focused,” cross-cutting work that better links all aspects of development. A critical aspect seems to be a modern approach to development that considers factors that makes youth vulnerable to extremism — a connection UNDP stressed this year in a report on Africa, for example. It will be interesting to watch how Steiner, who also spoke about development as a “foundation for young people” at a youth and extremism forum this year, continues to push this dialogue forward. As UNDP works to engage in work as diverse as climate change and reunification programs in Mosul, it will be key to also track how its new plan is actually implemented, as well as its success in financing it. The agency hopes to have 11 percent more in available resources over the next four years, increasing its budget from about $23 billion to $25 billion. Natalia Kanem: executive director of the United Nations Population Fund Guterres’ decision to appoint Natalia Kanem as executive director of the United Nations Population Fund was widely welcomed by the aid community in October. Kanem had been unexpectedly elevated to the position of UNFPA acting executive director in June, following the sudden death of her former boss, Babatunde Osotimehin. She already had four months experience on the job when her formal selection arrived. Kanem is the first Latin American to head the agency, and, as a woman, adds credence to Guterres’ pledges to improve equality within the United Nations. While her appointment happened somewhat quickly, many sexual and reproductive health rights experts agreed that Kanem was a logical, popular choice. She offered a safe pair of hands to steer UNFPA through a turbulent political and financial time, especially considering the U.S. government’s policy and budget decisions, which reduced support to family planning. UNFPA lost more than $32 million in core funding after President Donald Trump’s decided to defund the agency in April, depriving the organization of its second-largest donor. The expanded version of the “global gag rule” introduced by Trump at the start of the year has also put increased pressure on UNFPA funds and activities. But UNFPA faces more than just opposition from the U.S. It also has to navigate the tricky waters of religious and moral conservatism present in many African nations. This was brought into the spotlight during last month’s meeting of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, or IAWG, which includes U.N. agencies and civil society groups. A major agenda item was revising the Minimum Initial Service Package, or MISP, for Reproductive Health, the field manual for aid workers providing reproductive health services in the initial phase of a humanitarian crisis. Advocates pushed hard for the MISP to include access to safe abortion for the first time. Ultimately, UNFPA delegates negotiated a compromise in which safe abortion was included as a footnote, citing concerns that due to its sensitive nature, including abortion could cause some country governments to reject the overall package, as Devex reported. Advocates will be watching closely to see whether UNFPA could be retreating from tackling divisive issues such as abortion and also comprehensive sexual education and LGBTQI-community rights.

62,91796,"Opinion: How public-private partnerships can unlock billions for health financing By 2050, the world’s population is expected to rise to over 9 billion, with 2 billion people above the age of 60. Governments have agreed on a very ambitious set of Sustainable Development Goals to address the challenges inherent in population growth of this magnitude. Recent estimates by the World Health Organization published in The Lancet state that reaching SDG 3 — which addresses healthy lives and well-being — would require new investments increasing over time from an initial $134 billion annually to $371 billion by 2030 in order to address the health challenges for 67 low- and middle-income countries. To put this number in perspective: About the magnitude of this amount, the total global development aid across all sectors reached an all-time peak of $142.6 billion in 2016, an increase of 8.9 percent from 2015 after adjusting for exchange rates and inflation. It is clear that no single government, civil society, or the private sector can foot this bill. New mindsets, technologies, models for collaboration, financing, and delivery approaches are needed to ensure all people receive the care that they need. The good news is that we have already seen a few projects successfully tackling challenges of similar magnitude. We immunized 640 million children and prevented more than 9 million deaths in the process in the past 17 years. How? By 2000, global efforts for vaccinations had begun to plateau. To address that, a new business model was introduced in order to accelerate the access to lifesaving vaccines in the countries that need them the most. This was the birth of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance which took place at the World Economic Forum Annual meeting in Davos in 2000. Gavi’s model is to pool demand from the world’s poorest countries, sending a clear signal to manufacturers of a large and viable market for vaccines. Predictable, long-term donor support, together with country co-financing, provides security for countries to adopt vaccine programmes. It also makes it possible for manufacturers to make new investments in production capacity. As a country’s income grows, its co-financing payments gradually increase to reduce the donor reliance and sustainably cover the full cost of vaccines. Manufacturers are better able to plan their production and supply the right vaccines at more affordable prices. We saved 22 million lives from the deadliest infectious diseases AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in just 15 years. How? A new financing and partnership model was developed based on the principle that all those involved in the response to the diseases should be part of the decision-making process. Governments, civil society, communities affected by the diseases, technical partners, the private sector, faith-based organizations, and other funders must partner in the response which must be implemented by the countries themselves. Country ownership means that people determine their own solutions to fighting these three diseases, and take full responsibility for them. Each country tailors its response to the political, cultural, and epidemiological context. Ongoing financing depends upon performance and proven results, carefully monitored and verified by external parties called Local Fund Agents. This is how the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria operates: It is a financing institution, providing support to countries without implementing programs on the ground. Its 10-year anniversary was celebrated at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, when a new round of funding of $750 million was announced by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We can avoid the annual global cost of a severe pandemic which could reach as high as $570 billion, or 0.7% of global income. How? Ebola and now Zika demonstrate the persistent risks to countries which do not possess adequate capacities to prepare and respond to emerging pandemic threats. Ebola alone affected 28,639 people and caused 11,316 deaths, leading to a $2.2 billion in GDP lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, threatening not only macroeconomic stability but also food security, human capital development, and private sector growth. How can the world prepare for the next pandemic? The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is preparing us for that. CEPI wants to galvanize the development of new vaccines against diseases we know could cause the next devastating epidemic by creating an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations to tackle the barriers to epidemic vaccine development, advancing safe, effective, and affordable vaccines to contain outbreaks at the earliest possible stage. The focus is on two main objectives: Advancing at least four vaccine candidates against two to three priority pathogens to proof-of-concept in five years, to enable clinical efficacy testing in the initial stages of a potential outbreak; and building technical and institutional platforms to accelerate research and development response to known or unknown pathogen emergencies. CEPI is also exploring how to support multivalent Ebola vaccine R&D and facilitate regulatory preparedness and stockpiling. We can help emerging economies gain access to life-saving health care innovation. How? Most of the innovative technologies and health care delivery approaches today are very expensive for emerging economies. For example, access to health care professionals: Nigeria has roughly 14 percent of the number of doctors per capita of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. To catch up, it would need approximately 12 times as many doctors by 2030, requiring — under current training models — about $51 billion or 10 times current annual Nigerian public health spending. Thus, new models and approaches have to be adopted. One such approach is innovative financing provided through risk pooling, social impact bonds or equity investments, and deployed via health insurance, loans, extended payment terms or leasing structures such as managed equipment services, or MES. In Africa, the Kenyan government is providing citizens with access to improved medical services including the latest medical technologies, training and skills development across 98 Ministry of Health hospitals through an MES with GE Healthcare for over $450 million. This convenes implementation partners, lenders, risk insurers, and advisory services in a new approach for risk and reward sharing and credit underwriting, for a big ticket health care modernization. Another approach is based on innovative delivery systems. In Andhra Pradesh, India, the Health Management and Research Institute developed a program for pregnant women in remote areas to consult obstetricians and gynaecologists in Hyderabad through an internet-based video system accompanied by community health workers. Initial results indicate that the system has helped raise the rate of safe hospital or clinic deliveries by 50 percent. Building on the experiences with public-private partnerships, we might yet be able to find the billions our world’s global health goals require.

63,91802,"DevExplains: Green Climate Funds MANILA — Last April, the world's largest international climate fund rejected a proposal for the first time. Board members of the United Nations Green Climate Fund were conflicted about a roughly $100 million project designed to help more than a million Ethiopians — more than half of them women — adapt to severe droughts that have stricken the African country. The project, which was put forward by the U.N. Development Programme in tandem with the government of Ethiopia, suggested implementing a wide range of activities geared toward enhancing local resilience — such as improved access to water and introducing climate smart technologies. But most of the GCF's developed country board members were not convinced that the project should be funded. Part of the reason, they argued, was that it was a development project and not necessarily a climate change one. The decision baffled stakeholders. ""We've had a lot of internal soul searching about that particular proposal,"" Pradeep Kurukulasuriya, head of climate change and adaptation programming at UNDP, told Devex. The UNDP is far from alone. The question of where to draw the blurry line on what projects or aspects of projects are climate-related — and thus eligible for climate funding — and which are classed solely as “development” has periodically stumped even the most experienced climate finance experts. Two years after the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, developing countries and their climate finance partners are still figuring out how to thread that needle. With limited grant funding available, the winners will be those who can identify and secure critical resources for adaptation proposals that big climate funds deem worthy. ""It seems like the world of adaptation is cycling back to those issues right now, and people have been raising this question again and they've been citing the report again,"" Heather McGray, director of the Climate Justice Resilience Fund, told Devex referencing her 2007 report that detailed the relationship between adaptation and development. ""It’s a live question that in some respects is surprising, but in other respects, it reflects the nature of this particular challenge. It is not easy to overcome."" Climate change funds separate climate from development largely because the international community has already set aside a certain amount of money for development. Though the amount is rarely delivered on, economically advanced countries still continue to affirm their commitment to the 0.7 percent target set by the U.N. General Assembly. And so, when developed countries came together in 2009 and first committed $100 billion each year by 2020 for climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives, some argued that the money should be new. This is also what developing countries asked for, although the matter continues to be up for debate. For some projects, separating the two is simple. Most mitigation initiatives — such as renewable energy — fall clearly under the climate heading. One can quantify precisely how much a solar or geothermal project results in reduced or avoided emissions that would have otherwise accumulated due to the use of dirty energy sources like coal and oil. But making the green funding argument for adaptation projects can be tricky when so much of it touches upon development. It all boils down to context. In some situations where the development baseline of a country or a community is so low, making the distinction between climate and development hardly matters: Any measures that will improve their wealth will improve their adaptive capacity. For developing countries with a higher development baseline, however, being able to distinguish between climate and development is a useful ability that can result in a higher likelihood of winning those green grants. Some adaptation projects are relatively easier to untangle than others. These largely have to do with infrastructure because they're easier to compartmentalize. For instance, if you build a road, that part of the project is development. What additives you include to make it climate resilient — such as raising the road to protect it against floods or changing the location of the road to higher ground — constitute adaptation and hence qualify for climate funds. Where the tension between adaptation and development comes into the sharpest focus is in projects that involve agriculture, water, and livelihoods. The strongest proposals demonstrate that what is being funded really takes its root in something that is directly attributable to climate change as opposed to something that is avoidable yet exacerbated by climate change, which, while important, climate funds can argue against. For instance, maize, which is grown by smallholder farmers, relies heavily on regular rainfall rather than on irrigation to thrive. And since 2015, its production in Southern and Eastern Africa has drastically fallen as a result of record-setting droughts plaguing the region. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology predict that climate change will further exacerbate the situation as global temperatures rise over the next century. Since there are climate related impacts and vulnerabilities, a strong adaptation proposal can be made, which might include switching to other crops such as millets that are able to withstand the harsher conditions that some African farmers now face. By comparison, improper land use in certain countries is also exacerbated by climate change, but because it was avoidable to begin with some funds could argue against providing additional climate money. ""What's interesting is that it's not just a single switch from maize to something else,"" said UNDP's Kurukulasuriya. ""It's the likely means to switch again over time as conditions continue to change. This is part of the problem with climate change. It's not just that change is occurring, but that change is occurring at a faster rate than it has in mankind's lifetime. The need to have that flexibility to understand what's happening around you and to change with that at the right time, becomes an incredibly important part of the armoury that countries now have to develop."" Assessing whether or not an impact is climate related requires undertaking a significant amount of climate modeling work or analysis, which Kurukulasuriya said is one of the major challenges that developing countries struggle with. Other common challenges, he notes, include lack of historical data at the community level and lack of technical capacity for forecasting the impacts of climate change as well as the effects of adaptation in both the near- and long-term. ""So it becomes a question of ‘what can we do on top of what's already been done to ensure that these additional risks of climate change are managed better?’"" --— Pradeep Kurukulasuriya, head of climate change and adaptation programming at UNDP For organizations and developing countries still intent on formulating an adaptation proposal, the best way to pinpoint what adaptation finance should focus on is by first establishing a development baseline, then doing additionality reasoning in terms of management of risks associated with climate change hazards, advises Kurulasuriya. Establishing a baseline entails looking at what is being done today to address the non-climate change related drivers of the underlying problem and what is likely to happen without any additional interventions, given the reality unfolding in terms of climate change — that is, the likely range of effects or impacts. Then, in order to establish the “climate change additionality” rationale of a project, organizations have to identify those additional results that need to be achieved to minimize the effects of specific climate change induced impacts. This thought process is what allows one to formulate and justify the importance of select adaptation interventions that address the drivers that are directly attributable to climate change. ""So it becomes a question of ‘what can we do on top of what's already been done to ensure that these additional risks of climate change are managed better?’"" said Kurukulasuriya. ""When you do that, you realize there's a lot of co-benefits to other development gains that you're also interested in achieving, such as women's empowerment, and you try to maximize those as much as possible."" Climate change funds It's important to note that adaptation projects are highly contextualized and what is a strong adaptation project in one community, or for one climate change fund, isn't necessarily the same for another. There's a granularity for the various international climate funds that centers on incremental costs. For instance, the Least Developed Countries Fund, which is part of the Global Environment Facility at the World Bank, requires a country's business as usual development plan and will only fund the increment — what additional funds are needed to reduce any climate induced risks or hazards. Distinguishing between the two is a bit easier because the LDCF supports mainly planning processes, including the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programs of action, or NAPAs, and some of the activities that come out of it. Also, the fund provides rubrics and technical guidelines, which admittedly offer pretty light guidance, but nonetheless help somewhat demystify the process. On the other hand, the Kyoto Protocol's Adaptation Fund doesn't do incremental costs. Instead, it offers full cost financing for a concrete, localized project that helps vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt and build resilience to the negative effects of climate change. They don't try to define adaptation, but instead focus on the justification. ""Project proposals identify climate risks, and respond to them accordingly with targeted responses and that is why you see a diverse range of adaptation sectors,"" said Mikko Ollikainen, manager of the Adaptation Fund Board Secretariat, adding that sectors vary from food security to disaster risk reduction. The fund's secretariat and board do at times toggle back and forth about whether a proposed activity is climate related or sufficiently represents adaptation. ""In cases where the Board does not view the proposal to be addressing adaptation, the climate impact or risk identified in the proposal is not clearly addressed by the proposed activities,"" notes Ollikainen. Oftentimes the project is revised by the implementing entity and brought forward at a later time. The Green Climate Fund Currently, the most politicized and enigmatic fund is the Green Climate Fund. The GCF is relatively young when compared to other climate change funds, and hence has yet to really figure out its approach to adaptation. Since it became operational two years ago, the fund has agreed to fully support approved adaptation project proposals where there are discreet interventions that would not have occurred, but for climate change. For instance, it fully funded a UNDP proposal to support Pakistan in addressing glacial outbursts given that the ensuing floods meet the aforementioned criteria. But Ewen McDonald, co-chair of the GCF, told Devex that incremental costs are a lot more complex, and it is an issue that the fund's board will be turning to next year. ""We actually requested work from the secretariat on the development and application of an incremental cost calculation methodology and/or alternative methodologies as appropriate,"" said McDonald. ""Incremental costs are certainly on the agenda of the board."" Developing countries on the front lines of climate change eagerly anticipated the creation of the GCF and its mandate to allocate half of all grant funding from its roughly $8 billion budget for adaptation. While the Fund's board members have yet to reach a consensus on what the GCF should define as adaptation, the Fund has identified four ""results areas"" related to adaptation that it thinks will deliver ""major"" climate benefits. These range from enhancing livelihoods for the most vulnerable people to increasing health and well-being. The need for increased support for adaptation is undeniable, but the type of projects that the GCF chooses to support have been subject to heavy criticism and scrutiny by several civil society organizations and developing countries. ""Even when projects are approved, they tend to be very large scale infrastructure projects and very little of the funds actually go down to the grassroots, the most vulnerable communities and that's a very big disconnect,"" said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change & Development. ""They should be the priority."" Community-based adaptation projects should also have the potential to be scaled up, as part of the fund's goal to promote a ""paradigm shift."" But it is not easy to pinpoint what are the best activities to propose, especially when there's so much that humanity still doesn't know about how climate change is going to unfold in the future. Even if an organization or a government can identify what the ideal activities needed for a community to adapt to the harsh realities of climate change are, it is unrealistic for them to come forward with a proposal asking for hundreds of millions of dollars with every single thing planned out and justified. So CJRF’s McGray recommends that large international climate funds such as the GCF make sure that each of their projects create some sort of ""adaptation hypothesis."" ""It will probably take a checklist or a set criteria to make sure that the project has done justice to understanding its climate risk context, and has proposed adaptation activities that 'hypothesize' a logical solution to those risks. Good projects will also have ways to track whether their 'adaptation hypothesis' is working out, and how to adjust if it's not."" The other part of the challenge with scaling-up is that the best way to enhance a community's resilience to the effects of climate change often is to integrate adaptation into other decision-making processes. When you do that, it may not be very expensive, so it doesn’t lend itself to pitching a big project. ""Figuring out how to pitch the mainstreaming process in a way that’s really compelling and gets funded would be really important and powerful to do,"" she said. ""We need funds to evolve beyond a strictly projectized mentality."" GCF's McDonald acknowledges the challenge facing the climate change adaptation community. He said that one way the GCF is trying to reach the necessary level of ambition when it comes to adaptation is by supporting projects that can be scaled up by being replicated. He points to the almost $40 million project in the Pacific island of Tuvalu that the GCF approved back in 2016 and is already being replicated in other small island developing states. The project focuses on building coastal resilience through activities like creating sea walls, which are critical defenses for many low-lying countries vulnerable to rising sea levels. ""I'd encourage countries to not only think about their own specific country, but to think about the opportunities around a similar region, similar countries, or similar thematic groups,"" said McDonald, pointing out that the Caribbean, for instance, is facing similar threats to Pacific small island developing states. ""You can scale a project or scale the ambition or get together and be creative and come up with ideas that might work. To maximize the benefit of the GCF, to maximize the opportunity to respond to climate change, we have to think in a creative, different way about how we can put these projects together."" * Update, Jan. 10, 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that there is a debate over whether the pledged climate change money must be new. Read more Devex coverage on climate change.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Board members of the United Nations Green Climate Fund were conflicted about a roughly $100 million project designed to help more than a million Ethiopians — more than half of them women — adapt to severe droughts that have stricken the African country. And since 2015, its production in Southern and Eastern Africa has drastically fallen as a result of record-setting droughts plaguing the region. There's a granularity for the various international climate funds that centers on incremental costs. On the other hand, the Kyoto Protocol's Adaptation Fund doesn't do incremental costs. The fund's secretariat and board do at times toggle back and forth about whether a proposed activity is climate related or sufficiently represents adaptation. ""In cases where the Board does not view the proposal to be addressing adaptation, the climate impact or risk identified in the proposal is not clearly addressed by the proposed activities,"" notes Ollikainen. The GCF is relatively young when compared to other climate change funds, and hence has yet to really figure out its approach to adaptation. While the Fund's board members have yet to reach a consensus on what the GCF should define as adaptation, the Fund has identified four ""results areas"" related to adaptation that it thinks will deliver ""major"" climate benefits. ""It will probably take a checklist or a set criteria to make sure that the project has done justice to understanding its climate risk context, and has proposed adaptation activities that 'hypothesize' a logical solution to those risks. Good projects will also have ways to track whether their 'adaptation hypothesis' is working out, and how to adjust if it's not.""","For organizations and developing countries still intent on formulating an adaptation proposal, the best way to pinpoint what adaptation finance should focus on is by first establishing a development baseline, then doing additionality reasoning in terms of management of risks associated with climate change hazards, advises Kurulasuriya. It's important to note that adaptation projects are highly contextualized and what is a strong adaptation project in one community, or for one climate change fund, isn't necessarily the same for another. Assessing whether or not an impact is climate related requires undertaking a significant amount of climate modeling work or analysis, which Kurukulasuriya said is one of the major challenges that developing countries struggle with. For developing countries with a higher development baseline, however, being able to distinguish between climate and development is a useful ability that can result in a higher likelihood of winning those green grants. ""It will probably take a checklist or a set criteria to make sure that the project has done justice to understanding its climate risk context, and has proposed adaptation activities that 'hypothesize' a logical solution to those risks. McGray recommends that large international climate funds such as the GCF make sure that each of their projects create some sort of ""adaptation hypothesis."" And so, when developed countries came together in 2009 and first committed $100 billion each year by 2020 for climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives, some argued that the money should be new. Project proposals identify climate risks, and respond to them accordingly with targeted responses and that is why you see a diverse range of adaptation sectors,"" said Mikko Ollikainen, manager of the Adaptation Fund Board Secretariat, adding that sectors vary from food security to disaster risk reduction. For instance, the Least Developed Countries Fund, which is part of the Global Environment Facility at the World Bank, requires a country's business as usual development plan and will only fund the increment — what additional funds are needed to reduce any climate induced risks or hazards. The need for increased support for adaptation is undeniable, but the type of projects that the GCF chooses to support have been subject to heavy criticism and scrutiny by several civil society organizations and developing countries.",1
64,91804,"10 most baffling UK aid headlines of 2017 LONDON — Whether it was news about Brexit or U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.K. aid community often woke up to a headache in their newsfeeds in 2017. But peppered throughout those blows were several gut punches from British tabloids regarding “wasted,” “funneled,” or “snaffled” U.K. aid. For many, Sunday morning wouldn’t feel right without a Daily Express campaign to end the 13 billion pound aid budget, and any aid communication professional’s CV wouldn’t be complete without at least one robust public defense against claims from the Daily Mail. Fortunately, the evidence is mounting that these media assaults on aid aren’t swaying the public, at least for now. Before twisted headlines sink the aid industry, Devex rounds up some of 2017’s most migraine-inducing. 1. Most ENIGMATIC capitalization The headline writers of the Daily Express are connoisseurs of capitalization, thrilling and chilling in equal measure with a simple keystroke. But much like their approach to unpacking U.K. aid policy, the Express’ capitalization strategy is couched in mystery and intrigue. This headline caught our eye for favoring “stationery” over “furniture,” yet nothing in the article explains their preconceived suspicion of pens and paper. (Runner up: here) 2. Most racist The Daily Mail has published an impressive number of aid-waste stories related to takeaways this year (obviously someone’s setting deadlines too close to the lunch break) but Devex felt this one took the biscuit, so to speak. The story itself has nothing to do with takeaways; it’s just that one of its subjects happens to be Chinese. (Other takeaway headline: here) 3. Best use of the phrase “fat cats” It might be an understatement to say that the for-profit development business model is yet to win favor with British tabloids. Stuck in an era when nuns, monks, St. Bernards, and other figures transcending income were best suited to deliver aid, many use the phrase “fat cats” to describe those working in development who make a profit or salary from their skills, even if the dollar amount shrivels in comparison to the non-development private sector. But the phrase “fat cats” is catchy, kind of cute, and best of all, it allows tabloids to snag readers who might’ve otherwise just been Googling images of obese cats to cheer themselves up. (Runner-up here) 4. Then how SHOULD we help the coconuts? Why does everyone hate coconuts? Both the Daily Mail and the Express really took aim at aid funding for the delicious fruit. Look out for Devex’s upcoming campaign #SaveTheCoconuts. (Runner ups: here and here) 5. Most modest Always take credit where credit is due. 6. Best alternate use of foreign aid (non-NHS) When the tabloid media calls for the abolition of the aid budget, their usual suggestion is to divert the money to the National Health Service. But after Hurricane Irma ravaged Caribbean islands this year, their idea was instead to divert foreign aid to help in the recovery of British overseas territories. Turns out, one of the prices one pays for owning climate change-vulnerable lands is covering the cost when things go wrong. 7. Best alternate use of foreign aid (NHS) This old chestnut. No one is arguing that the NHS doesn’t deserve billions in additional funding, but after the Brexit campaign, one would think sweeping calls for diverting any budget to the NHS might merit more research. 8. Most self-defeating The headline says it best. (Runner-up: here) 9. Most baffling … … ... ? 10. Best reveal Related to the campaign against coconut aid, 2017 was a great year for creative reveals of outrageous aid spending. This one lambasts aid spending on anti-smoking campaigns and cooling mechanisms in China and India. It seems the paper’s chief complaint, however, is that aid is spent in China and India at all, which are wealthy nations and not “the world’s poorest.” As it turns out, of course, most of the world’s poor do actually live in India and China.

65,91818,"Opinion: Africa needs investment in palliative care Palliative care services are seriously lacking in Africa. Nineteen percent of African countries do not have identified palliative services and 71 percent of the services that do exist are concentrated in Uganda, South Africa, and Kenya. The HIV epidemic played a driving role in developing palliative care services and resources in many countries in Africa, with initial funding in HIV helping to boost hospices and palliative care services on the continent. However, a decrease in funding as well as a move away from vertical, disease-specific funding to horizontal, health systems funding is negatively affecting palliative care service delivery and development in many countries across the continent. New research — supported by the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai — shows that while palliative care developed rapidly in South Africa through funding available for HIV, the proliferation of earmarked funds for hospices mean programs are often only allowed to care for patients with HIV that had palliative needs. This is the same in other countries, such as Côte d’Ivoire, where the majority of hospice services are only available for HIV patients. Currently, hospices are seeing non-HIV patients through funds provided by private donors in addition to public funds and grants. This interplay between HIV and palliative care reflects the short- and long-term benefits, as well as harm, that earmarked global aid can play in the health care systems of recipient countries. Dwindling aid budgets will continue to disrupt necessary end-of-life and palliative services for patients in Africa. Many programs have already been forced to scale back due to reduced foreign aid budgets. Beyond HIV, patients across Africa increasingly need palliative care from diseases and complications such as cancers, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, kidney diseases, and neurological disorders. These new developments are increasing demand for palliative care not because of untreated HIV/AIDS, but because of improved survivorship among those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as the complications of aging and HIV medicines. So, what can be done? Global actors and stakeholders can focus efforts on increasing access to palliative care in Africa, using the model of the World Health Organization’s public health strategy for palliative care: 1. Palliative care-specialized services: Services should not be limited to disease-specific silos — ie: for HIV but not other diseases — but rather should allow for the taking care of any disease condition that is in need of palliative care, and pain and symptom management. 2. Education: Sustainable palliative care training programs, such as the program at Hospice Africa Uganda, which trains health care professionals from any African country, should continue to be supported through funding and partnerships to build a stronger base of professionals that can then go on to be teachers in palliative care in their respective countries. 3. Policies: Although disease-specific policies and funding has led to the initial investment in palliative care, countries should move away from disease-specific policies and funding, and move to building comprehensive stand-alone palliative care policies and funding structures within the ministries of health. 4. Medicines: Advocates should focus on working with their respective governments in covering low-cost medicines, such as the Essential Package of palliative care, starting with increasing access to low-cost, affordable morphine. Due to this shifting landscape and overall decreases in funding, governments in Africa will need to increase the share of funding for palliative care. Not doing so will result in millions dying with minimal-to-no access to palliative care and pain management. This is especially dire in Africa, where many still lack access to treatments for HIV or cancer. Without increasing access to palliative care services, thousands of patients will die in pain and with poor symptom control.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The HIV epidemic played a driving role in developing palliative care services and resources in many countries in Africa, with initial funding in HIV helping to boost hospices and palliative care services on the continent.

66,91847,"Which Chinese companies are the big development players? CANBERRA — More than 30,000 development contracts have been awarded since 2015, providing more than $185 billion in support to developing countries. Of this total, $8.7 billion have been awarded to more than 800 companies headquartered in China. By analyzing the development contracts, Devex presents an exclusive look at China’s biggest development players, their global footprint, and the donors supporting their work. Who are China’s big development players? Major infrastructure, energy and engineering projects dominate the development contracts awarded to Chinese-headquartered companies since 2015. The top five companies based on the total value of contracts are all engineering focused and state owned. Combined, these companies have won contracts valued at nearly $2.5 billion since 2015. Here are the top five. 1. China Gezhouba Group From just six contracts, the China Gezhouba Group has been the biggest development player in China since 2015, being awarded development contracts to the value of $942 million. Supporting the design, construction, investment, and operation of large energy, transportation, and other construction projects, with a corporate mission statement to promote social progress and improve living standards, the footprint of the China Gezhouba Group can be found on every continent excluding North America. In the development sector, they have been contracted by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, with development activities based in Pakistan and China. Their single biggest contract, awarded in March 2017, was a $617 million project for the World Bank to support the construction of underground power complexed, tunnels and hydraulic steel structures in Pakistan. 2. Sinohydro Second on the list by value of contracts is Sinohydro, a company providing end-to-end services for large infrastructure and civil works projects with the mission “building a sustainable future.” With regional offices in Côte d'Ivoire, Georgia, Pakistan, Sudan, and Venezuela, Sinohydro have positioned themselves as an important player in supporting major infrastructure projects in developing countries — and they have been awarded with 23 contracts worth $700 million since 2015, the highest number of contracts for a company headquartered in China. The source of development funding for Sinohydro has been the leading development banks — the ADB, African Development Bank, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank. Their single largest project awarded in the past three years was an $89 million project supporting the reconstruction and improvement of a major road in Armenia for the EIB. 3. China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation has been supporting development projects since the 1960s. Since 2015, this engineering company has supported 16 projects valued at $307 million — the largest, a $144 million hydropower project in Dasu, Pakistan, for the World Bank. Other donors include the AfDB, ADB and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. And in addition to Pakistan, CECC have supported infrastructure and other construction projects in Botswana, Montenegro, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Tonga, and Vanuatu. 4. China Road and Bridge Corporation The state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation specializes in the contracting, investment, development, and operation of large transportation, real estate, and industrial projects. Since 2015, they have been awarded four major development contracts — totalling $278 million. The largest of the four projects, valued at $205 million, was for the reconstruction of 178 kilometers of road in Afghanistan for the ABD. The ADB has additionally employed the CRBC for projects in Myanmar while the AfDB has utilized their services to support projects in Africa. 5. Xinjiang Beixin Road and Bridge Engineering Company Ltd. The Xinjiang Beixin Road and Bridge Engineering Company is state owned and focused purely on the construction of roads and bridges. Since 2015, they have been awarded 14 contracts supporting development projects — totalling $222 million. Their largest projects, awarded in September 2016, was a $41 million project supporting the construction of a major motorway in Pakistan awarded by the ADB. The World Bank has been their other major donor over the past three years with Cambodia, China, and Tajikistan as other locations of infrastructure projects supported by the company. Spreading the wealth While the top five account for more than a quarter of contracts awarded to Chinese-headquartered companies since 2015, Devex have identified more than 800 companies involved in development projects. More than three-quarters of companies were recipients of single development contracts over the past three years, suggesting Chinese-headquartered companies — big and small — are considering development-focused contracts as a means of progressing and advancing business opportunities. What are the locations of projects? According to the analysis, more than two-thirds of contracts were for projects based in China — and not just engineering projects. The diverse range of projects include a lake rehabilitation project, ecological restoration project, the provision of visibility equipment supporting humanitarian responses, a project supporting the advancement of religious freedoms, and economic transformation and capacity building. Outside of their own borders, Chinese-headquartered companies have supported projects in 64 countries topped by Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Outside of China, development projects are dominated by transportation, energy and other construction projects — with some interesting exceptions. In Bangladesh, YTO International supplied $851,000 worth of mobile rehabilitation vans for the World Bank. In Guyana, Beijing DHC Digital Technology Company won a $406,000 contract to improve teacher education. In Uzbekistan, Xinjiang Ramadan International Trade supported a $2.6 million health systems improvement project. Within Asia, the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control were awarded $500,000 to support the establishment of a tobacco control and health fund. And at the lower end of contract values, the China Tianjin Recare Company were awarded just under $8,000 for the supply of Hepatitis B and C rapid tests kits to Myanmar. Who are the donors? There have been thirteen donors employing the services of Chinese-headquartered companies since 2015 to assist their development programs. Topping the list of donors is the ADB — the primary source of funding for Chinese companies, accounting for 66 percent of all contracts awarded to them since 2015. The ADB is followed by the World Bank who have awarded 304 contracts, or 23 percent and the AfDB with 3 percent of contracts. But the diverse donors also include the Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, EIB, Ford Foundation, IADB, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the United Nations. The big names missing over the past three years have been the United States Agency for International Development, Department for International Development, the German Society for International Cooperation and other major national aid programs. What can we expect in 2018? In 2018, we expect there will be a continuation of Chinese-headquartered companies receiving major engineering contracts from development banks — primarily the ADB and World Bank. But the growing push for China to be a leader in environmental protection could see some Chinese companies — especially state-owned companies — shying away from bidding for large-scale projects that could be perceived as promoting dirty energy solutions. Clean energy projects would more likely dominate their services, showing China as an important leader in creating an environmentally sustainable future. In demonstrating their development leadership, Chinese-based research organizations and universities may increasingly bid for development grants. Beijing Normal University, China Agricultural University, Harbin Medical University, Peking University and Tsinghua University are among the research institutes already successful in receiving grants from the Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, and Rockefeller Brothers Fund since 2015. More applications, and more successes, could help Chinese institutes to become leading thinkers on development solutions.

67,91850,"Bill Gates makes the business case for breakthroughs in global health SAN FRANCISCO — On Monday, Bill Gates spoke with an audience of health care professionals, and made the business case for pursuing breakthroughs in global health. The chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was a keynote speaker at the first day of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, the largest health care industry gathering. He outlined ambitious goals for global health, such as cutting the number of annual deaths of children under five down to 2.5 million in the next 15 years. And as he asked the private sector to join the Gates Foundation and its partners in this work, which is the key priority of the largest foundation in the world, he made the case not in terms of corporate social responsibility, but rather because it makes good business sense. “It’s really the private sector that has the skills, experience, the capacity to turn discoveries into the viable products,” he said at the San Francisco event. “And so that’s why this engagement is so critical.” Gates discussed the growing convergence between philanthropy and industry in developing solutions for diseases in rich countries as well as poor countries. He talked about advances against diseases such as obesity, Alzheimer’s, and cancer, and explained how they could translate to solutions for infectious diseases. His talk was a call to action for the audience to take some of the health care innovations like those featured on the agenda at the J.P. Morgan conference and apply them to diseases facing the world’s poor, as part of the guiding belief of the Gates Foundation that all lives have equal value. A call for innovation Gates discussed progress against diseases including malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, going so far as to say that almost half of neglected tropical diseases are no longer neglected, as several of them are on the pathway to elimination. “What we need is more innovation, and of course that’s why I’m here today,” he said. The billionaire philanthropist went on to talk about how the foundation has partnered with other institutions, including universities, biotechnology startups, pharmaceutical companies, all with the goal of accelerating this global health progress. “The goal is to get medicines and vaccines out to everybody who needs them and so that’s a case of innovating and it’s a case of being able to finance those and having the delivery systems,” he said. While the foundation is involved in each of these areas, the bottleneck is on the innovation side, Gates said, explaining that the tools and discoveries private sector companies are working on can make a huge difference in public health. “The market isn’t naturally going to create a malaria vaccine. There’s just no financial reward for doing that. And yet the private sector expertise has been key to the progress we’ve made in doing that.” --— Bill Gates, co-founder and chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Much of the conversation centered around the important role of government funding for basic research on diseases of the poor, in the United States, Europe, and China, which he called a particular focus for the Gates Foundation. When it comes to backing high risk science and staying patient, philanthropy can complement the government, and serve as a bridge to the private sector, he said. Academic insights are not enough, Gates continued, noting the importance of biotechnology expertise from manufacturability to cost reduction. The market opportunity Gates went on to describe the poor countries where his foundation focuses its work as markets where drugmakers might make profits while saving lives. As the world goes from 7.4 billion to 11 billion people, all of that increase except for a billion in Asia will be in Africa, he said, explaining that developing countries in Asia and Africa will be by far “the largest patient pools in the world.” Gates presented the foundation as a partner to these companies, noting their work in complementary areas like sanitation, financial services, and agricultural development, and making it clear that the foundation’s political relationships and distribution networks could set these companies up for success. He explained that the Gates Foundation works mostly through grants, with more than $12 billion over the last 5 years distributed to a range of institutions including pharmaceutical companies. Gates also talked about a growing emphasis at the foundation on program-related investments, including equity investments and price and volume guarantees, explaining that this has gone from 5 percent of what they do up to 15 percent, and adding that he sees this growing. “The creativity of how we can get in at an early stage, find platforms that are of common value for rich world health and developing world health, that’s really the ideal for us,” he said. These investments have led to new drugs and vector control work and accelerated the introduction of vaccines, which Gates called the one category where the foundation has had the greatest success. In the afternoon, Gates Foundation directors Andrin Oswald, who leads Life Sciences Partnerships, and Andrew Farnum, director of its Program Related Investments, held a session at the J.P. Morgan conference, offering further details on opportunities for partnership with the Gates Foundation in a session called “Reaching More Patients Through Innovation.” Breakthroughs across borders Cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses the immune system to treat cancer, is the best example of the overlap between the research agendas in biotech, pharma and global health, Gates said. He also noted the interplay between the gut microbiome and nutrition, another priority of the foundation. Gates said his foundation wants to partner at an early stage to see whether products developed for rich countries can save lives in poor countries. “The breakthroughs that are happening in your labs not only can be an economic success and help in the developed countries,” he said. “They literally have a chance to accelerate this idea of health equity and saving literally millions of lives.” He mentioned this Wall Street Journal headline that caught his eye: “How HIV became a cancer cure.” He said he hopes for an opposite headline in the next decade, that immuno oncology can lead to a cure for HIV. The global health community is holding the line on HIV, but “without breakthroughs and continued generosity,” the world could return to peak levels of infections and deaths. “In infectious disease though, there is a a lot of low hanging fruit,” he said. “Many of these diseases, there just hasn’t been that much work done, so if we can get the latest tools involved, we have a good chance of success.” Gates pointed to past examples of the private sector taking on the cause of public health, like when venture capitalists Bob Nelsen and Bob More helped raise $500 million from groups including the Gates Foundation for VIR Biotechnology, which is focused on taking on infectious diseases. Devex has also reported on a collaboration between J.P. Morgan and the Gates Foundation called the Global Health Investment Fund, which seeks a traditional return and grantlike impact for global health research and development. Other examples of these public private partnerships appear in this blog post from Gates featuring his remarks as prepared for delivery. “The reason that our foundation focuses on global health is we saw it as the place that we could have the greatest impact,” Gates said. “The market isn’t naturally going to create a malaria vaccine. There’s just no financial reward for doing that. And yet the private sector expertise has been key to the progress we’ve made in doing that. So we saw philanthropy as the thing that could come in and help reduce that gap.” The role of philanthropy Gates talked about the $1.5 billion Advance Market Commitment for the pneumococcus vaccine, which targets pneumonia. The foundation helped to launch this effort that brought other donors together to get manufacturers to compete for the money in order to ensure a high volume, low-cost supply of the vaccine. He called the pneumococcus vaccine an amazing success story because it is getting to most children in the world, explaining that the foundation did something similar with rotavirus, in an approach that could be applied to other medicines. “Things like: Can we ever use genetic editing to create an HIV cure? Clearly that’s not something that’s going to happen anytime soon,” he said. “But we can afford to invest tens or even hundreds of millions in that if it’s a promising approach because it would be so phenomenal in changing the course of that disease.” While it is not alone among institutions ranging from the Rockefeller Foundation to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in its work with the private sector on public health challenges, the Gates Foundation is “in a unique position to take on long-term problems,” Gates said, noting that a combination of growing spending and accelerating scientific understanding is creating major potential for impact. He emphasized that the foundation comes in not just with money, but with technical expertise, like scientists who understand vaccinology, and can be long term partners and advisers. The Gates Foundation can provide more predictability to companies that are looking to enter new markets, he said. To make sure these drugs cost less in countries that are more price sensitive, the foundation can make volume and price guarantees, and negotiate access agreements as part of the partnership, he added. Gates often calls himself an impatient optimist, and his remarks on the private sector opportunity in public health pointed to why, when he said the last 25 years have been great for global health, but he hopes to see the same type of reduction of disease in the next 15 years. “Achieving health equity in our lifetime is not just a possibility. It’s almost an imperative because everyone deserves a chance to live a healthy and productive life. And we look forward to working with you to make that a reality,” he said.

The market isn’t naturally going to create a malaria vaccine. There’s just no financial reward for doing that. And yet the private sector expertise has been key to the progress we’ve made in doing that. When it comes to backing high risk science and staying patient, philanthropy can complement the government, and serve as a bridge to the private sector, he said. Gates presented the foundation as a partner to these companies, noting their work in complementary areas like sanitation, financial services, and agricultural development, and making it clear that the foundation’s political relationships and distribution networks could set these companies up for success. The creativity of how we can get in at an early stage, find platforms that are of common value for rich world health and developing world health, that’s really the ideal for us, he said. These investments have led to new drugs and vector control work and accelerated the introduction of vaccines, which Gates called the one category where the foundation has had the greatest success. The foundation helped to launch this effort that brought other donors together to get manufacturers to compete for the money in order to ensure a high volume, low-cost supply of the vaccine. But we can afford to invest tens or even hundreds of millions in that if it’s a promising approach because it would be so phenomenal in changing the course of that disease.","While it is not alone among institutions ranging from the Rockefeller Foundation to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in its work with the private sector on public health challenges, the Gates Foundation is “in a unique position to take on long-term problems,” Gates said, noting that a combination of growing spending and accelerating scientific understanding is creating major potential for impact. In the afternoon, Gates Foundation directors Andrin Oswald, who leads Life Sciences Partnerships, and Andrew Farnum, director of its Program Related Investments, held a session at the J.P. Morgan conference, offering further details on opportunities for partnership with the Gates Foundation in a session called “Reaching More Patients Through Innovation.” --— Bill Gates, co-founder and chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Much of the conversation centered around the important role of government funding for basic research on diseases of the poor, in the United States, Europe, and China, which he called a particular focus for the Gates Foundation. Gates pointed to past examples of the private sector taking on the cause of public health, like when venture capitalists Bob Nelsen and Bob More helped raise $500 million from groups including the Gates Foundation for VIR Biotechnology, which is focused on taking on infectious diseases. On Monday, Bill Gates spoke with an audience of health care professionals, and made the business case for pursuing breakthroughs in global health. Devex has also reported on a collaboration between J.P. Morgan and the Gates Foundation called the Global Health Investment Fund, which seeks a traditional return and grantlike impact for global health research and development. His talk was a call to action for the audience to take some of the health care innovations like those featured on the agenda at the J.P. Morgan conference and apply them to diseases facing the world’s poor, as part of the guiding belief of the Gates Foundation that all lives have equal value. While the foundation is involved in each of these areas, the bottleneck is on the innovation side, Gates said, explaining that the tools and discoveries private sector companies are working on can make a huge difference in public health. Gates often calls himself an impatient optimist, and his remarks on the private sector opportunity in public health pointed to why, when he said the last 25 years have been great for global health, but he hopes to see the same type of reduction of disease in the next 15 years. Breakthroughs across borders Cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses the immune system to treat cancer, is the best example of the overlap between the research agendas in biotech, pharma and global health, Gates said.",0
68,91851,"Opinion: How to improve collaboration in Earth observation for impact Collaboration is vital for sustainable development globally, as thousands of organizations and governments work towards shared goals. Without effective collaboration, efforts are duplicated, knowledge is lost, and impact is stunted. Collaborative networks in the development community are everywhere, from informal online communities of practice, to formal partnerships with designated coordination bodies. One example of the latter is the Earth observation community, which is working within the framework of the Group on Earth Observations to promote the use of open Earth data in decision making for the benefit of humankind. Collaboration is at the very heart of everything the GEO community does, but even with a decade of experience fostering partnerships between hundreds of members and thousands of contributors, it has not been achieved without its challenges and a wealth of lessons learned. A significant challenge GEO and other partnerships often face is being inclusive and collaborative across a large and diverse community, while still being targeted enough to deliver results that matter. With limited time and resources and so much work to be done, how can we best develop and get the most out of our collaborative efforts? How can we identify and prioritize partnerships? One way that GEO is tackling this challenge is by aligning our work around three strategic engagement priorities that address key global policy mandates: The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These engagement priorities are also tackled by a number of other global organizations, such as the United Nations Development Programme and the International Council for Science, through their work at the intersection of science and policy. By creating a framework for collaboration, we can better prioritize our time and resources to focus on partnerships that will be mutually beneficial and have maximum impact on our shared goals. Similar efforts are being made at the regional level through efforts to build partnerships that address context-specific priorities, including through GEO’s well-established regional initiatives AfriGEOSS, AOGEOSS, AmeriGEOSS, and EuroGEOSS, as well as other developing activities in the Arctic region, the Balkans, and the Himalayas. By defining priority areas, organizations are better oriented to connect with the right partners. Once your priorities are defined, you can research the organizations leading the charge and making impact in these areas and connect with them to share how your work will complement or further their own. In the case of GEO, it has guided our stakeholder engagement efforts and has led us to focus on strengthening relationships with the U.N. bodies responsible for global policy mandates in our priority areas, including the U.N. International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, U.N. Statistics Division, and the U.N. Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management. A good lesson that GEO has learned is that for research and policy agendas to make an impact there has to be relevant language included in national policy documents. This is why working with U.N. bodies is so key. “While relationships between organizations are important and provide sustainability when staff turnover occurs, it is individuals who lead and manage programs, work remotely in the field or in the office, write software code, or create project plans.” --— Steven Ramage, senior external relations manager, Group on Earth Observations Potential partners will be more likely to open their doors to you if you approach them with a clear value case for your partnership that demonstrates mutual benefit. It’s always worth reviewing what you write, to assess whether or not it’s just your organization that benefits, and amend the two-way balance accordingly. Once a potential partnership is identified, it is important to reflect on what defines your collaboration. For some, it will be formal avenues with clear roles and responsibilities, outlined in a memorandum of understanding or letter of intent. For others, it will be informal networks of personal relationships, opportunistic partnering and cooperation based on reciprocity and shared-values. Relationship-building is a crucial step towards effective partnership that is often overlooked in popular literature on collaboration. While relationships between organizations are important and provide sustainability when staff turnover occurs, it is individuals who lead and manage programs, work remotely in the field or in the office, write software code, or create project plans. This approach focuses on leveraging all team members’ personal relationships, experience, and community standing as a means to strengthen interorganizational collaboration. Effective collaboration is made possible when the whole team is empowered to build and maintain personal relationships at different levels, ranging from technical experts to government ministers. At a practical level, this could mean encouraging colleagues to attend industry events, to take advantage of webinars and training opportunities in their areas of expertise, or simply encouraging all team members to share their meeting plans and outcomes, in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page and no existing contacts or background is overlooked. Many of our most important successes have started with a simple personal relationship between team members on either side. One result of GEO’s relationship-building efforts has been the inclusion of language on Earth observations in the Sendai Framework Data Readiness Review 2017, made possible through using existing relationships with UNISDR. GEO supports our community to collaborate and involve cross-sector and cross-domain knowledge and expertise. These efforts include using our relationships to expand our network beyond the usual suspects to engage new and diverse groups that can benefit from the value of open Earth observation data and information. There are a range of other established and emerging leaders in our sector that are successful in such community development, including the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, the European Space Agency’s team working with international development banks, and some more recent entrants including the Global Partnership for Sustainable Data and Radiant Earth. GEO fosters communities of practice in many areas of Earth observations, including agriculture, health, and water, and supports regional initiatives that connect local efforts and resources. We support our partners’ efforts by providing expertise, coordination and communications support, and we receive the same in return. Based on our experience, it is important to define, or refine, our standard perspective on collaboration to focus equally on individual-level relationships. The GEO community is a thriving network of collaboration, with interpersonal relationships at its roots, and has demonstrated that leveraging personal connections is a foundational task for successful partnering.

70,91853,"UN chief Guterres gets a C+ on first feminist report card UNITED NATIONS — A coalition of women’s rights organizations and former United Nations staffers are handing U.N. chief António Guterres a passable C+ grade for his work so far in making the institution a more feminist one. The “Feminist U.N. Campaign” — composed of many of the same people who lobbied for the first female Secretary-General in 2016 — issued Guterres’ team with the report card on Tuesday, just over a year into his term. The campaign’s survey of more than 118 organizations from more than 40 countries, plus evaluation of Guterres’ speeches and appointments, reveal mixed progress. While the U.N. leader has met many of his initial promises, such as demanding gender parity at all levels, other challenges remain. Women civil society members continue to face limited access to U.N. processes and negotiations, the report’s authors say, and most decision-making and information-tracking is not done with transparency in mind. “This is a man who has got a lot on his plate, and we are evaluating what he does in terms of a feminist agenda,” explained Lyric Thompson, director of advocacy and policy at the International Center for Research on Women, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that released the report on behalf of the Feminist U.N. Campaign. “If we could have evaluated all of the Secretary-Generals before, they would have failed miserably. Guterres scored well on the things he said he would do. He appears to be a man of his word, but that is not the goal of the exercise. It’s to call out a culture of misogyny and patriarchy enshrined in the U.N. that does not serve the people.” The campaign considered six categories in its report: The development and implementation of a feminist agenda for the U.N.; a feminist implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals; transparent and accountable financing for gender equality; women’s leadership throughout the system; improved women’s rights institutions and forums in the U.N.; and increased freedom of information in the U.N. The report card issued Guterres’ team a collective score of 78 percent. The U.N. chief made several early high-level female appointments, including Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, and has laid out gender parity targets for all U.N. agencies to meet by 2030. He scored best on the question of a feminist agenda and women’s leadership throughout the system. However, he came up shortest on ensuring a feminist implementation and accountability for the SDGs, and promoting freedom of information in the U.N. system. The group recommends that some internal processes — such as decisions by Guterres’ executive committee on gender equality, whose meetings are currently confidential — should be reported or televised. It also recommends that Guterres ensures that data from his new initiatives is made public. This would include U.N. entities’ progress as they work to reach the gender parity targets Guterres has set. The U.N. Department of Public Information has also been tasked with setting up a system to track credible reports on sexual exploitation and abuse, as part of Guterres’ new gender parity strategy. In January 2017, Guterres announced a new high-level taskforce to strengthen the U.N.’s response to internal sexual abuse and exploitation cases. Tracking of these cases is still conducted on an internal basis only, and rarely results in punitive action, according to Charlotte Bunch, a co-author of the report and the founding director of the Center for Women’s Global Leadership at Rutgers University. Guterres “has convened a high-level taskforce and we hope it will recommend more transparency. If they don’t, we will recommend that, as the lack of transparency has worked against the victims ... most of the time,” she said. Bunch and her colleagues also take issue with the management of the new European Union-U.N. global initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls. Announced in September, the initial €500 million ($597 million) investment will be managed by a new U.N. multistakeholder trust fund, with support from UN Women, the U.N. Population Fund and the U.N. Development Programme, overseen by Guterres’ office. Bunch questioned the need to create a new entity to disperse the money when UN Women, one of the system’s smallest agencies with a budget of $203.8 million in 2018/19, could have taken on the initiative. “We felt UN Women was not supported strongly with a particularly big chunk of money,” she said. “It’d be as if money came for work on children and instead of going through UNICEF they set up a new program to administer the money. UNICEF should be the primary lead on that.” The campaign has shared its report card with Guterres’ team, and will now be turning its attention to the upcoming annual Commission on the Status of Women in March. At last year’s event, Guterres hosted his first-ever town hall with women’s civil society representatives, yet some NGO members complained of being blocked from attending events by security staff. *Update, Jan. 11, 2018:* This article has been updated to clarify that the Feminist U.N.

71,91856,"DRC peacekeeping forces prepare for a worsening 2018, UN's Lacroix says UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations is preparing for a worsening of the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and strengthening its armed forces there, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, told the Security Council on Tuesday. The U.N. Organization Stabilization Mission in DRC is launching a new Rapidly Deployable Battalion, trained to work in remote areas of the country that have increasingly come under siege by rebel groups in the huge Central African country. The new RDB battalion, to be joined by two additional ones later this year, will be trained in jungle warfare and the “asymmetric environment” they work in, Lacroix said. U.N. announced late last week that it was launching an investigation into the attacks on 15 U.N. Tanzanian peacekeepers who were killed in December, Lacroix said. Dozens more were injured in the hours-long battle with the rebel group Allied Democratic Forces. The attack occurred in the resource-rich region of North Kivu. “It underscores the volatility of the security situation in parts of DRC,” Lacroix said, noting that the impact of ongoing political violence has had a “severe” impact on the country’s civilian population. There are more than 4 million displaced people within DRC. Humanitarian groups such as CARE expect that humanitarian needs will grow this year, and the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance — approximately 8.5 million — could rise to 13.1 million. Long-delayed elections to replace President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, have also resulted in frustrations and tensions, Lacroix said, resulting in violent protests, arrests of citizens and a government-ordered shutdown of internet services late last year.

73,91870,"Opinion: In Bangladesh, arsenic poisoning is a national tragedy. Here's how to intervene. Arsenic poisoning from groundwater in Bangladesh is a national tragedy, posing a massive threat to public health. About 20 million people are exposed to harmful levels of the chemical element in their drinking water — over 50 parts per billion by national standards — and the figure is several times higher if measured by more stringent World Health Organization standards. Arsenic poisoning is often fatal, linked to increased rates of cancer and other disease. For most of the victims, and millions more yet to be born, there is no end in sight, despite major remedial efforts. With the well-being of so many people at stake, it is time to chart a faster route forward, based on a comprehensive and critical look at ongoing efforts to tackle the problem. About two decades ago, the government of Bangladesh embarked on a large-scale effort to test shallow household wells for arsenic, a geologically occurring contaminant. The spouts of hand pumps for wells deemed safe were painted green, and those not, red. Households were encouraged to drink only from the green wells. Research showed that up to five years later, as many as half of the households reached were drinking only from safe wells. More recently, the government has shifted to a strategy of introducing piped water from deep public tubewells and other safe sources, making it easier for households to access them. Implementation has proved disappointing, however. At the current annual rate of progress, according to our analysis, it will take more than 100 years to reach all of the most vulnerable people. Rural households in Bangladesh should not have to wait until the 22nd century for a solution to this devastating and lethal problem. We believe it is possible to quicken the pace of progress now, based on a combination of new technologies and policy measures. One promising technical solution is to spread the use of household filters, which enable people to rely on their own tubewells and avoid fetching water from distant sources. Costing about $40, filters could be made widely available through subsidies. A related approach employs filters to treat large volumes of water from community wells. Users typically pay a small monthly fee to cover the costs of maintenance and operations. A newer technique for removing arsenic from groundwater, called “in situ oxidation,” involves modifying the water, through the use of iron oxides and micro-organisms, before it is withdrawn from wells. Based on pilot testing in Bangladesh, the equipment and maintenance seem straightforward, but the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of this technique remain to be proven. Beyond pipe dreams: Getting the interventions right There is now a growing consensus around the need to take action in this crisis and make solutions more readily accessible. This will require several new policy measures that reflect a clear grasp of the arsenic crisis in Bangladesh. 1. Test and retest wells In the years since previous rounds of testing ended, the green or red paint on many wells has washed away. This, together with other changes such as the installation of new untested wells and the contamination of safe wells, have eroded the gains from earlier efforts. There is a clear need to renew testing and retesting through concerted campaigns that make reliable and affordable testing materials widely available for regular use. Test results must also be made readily accessible to the public, so they can inform local action. Renewed testing will also provide a foundation for effective targeting of new remedial measures, since the severity of the problem varies greatly, even within a single village, depending on geological and other conditions. 2. Widen the net The spread of shallow tubewells from the 1980s onwards came in response to high levels of harmful pathogens and other contaminants in surface water. As households cease to rely for drinking water on tubewells contaminated with arsenic, microbial contamination of alternative water sources will require increased attention. Researchers have identified other contaminants as well in the water supplies of rural households, including manganese, lead, nickel, and chromium. Fortunately, many of the measures that reduce arsenic are also effective against these other elements. Redoubled efforts to tackle arsenic thus represent an important opportunity to address multiple health threats through a more holistic approach to water contaminants. 3. Set sensible and fair priorities Given the magnitude of the arsenic problem and resource limitations at every level, rolling out new technologies is highly complex. To be both fair and realistic, programs must be guided by clear priorities as to where they will act, what they will do first, and which people will receive urgent attention. Even though much is known about where the arsenic problem is most severe, many studies cite cases in which remedial measures have been applied where the threat is low. Clearly, more must be done to improve targeting. New initiatives must also aim for equity, using tools such as social cost-effectiveness analysis to allocate scarce resources from both public and private sources. By taking into account costs such as women’s time and effort in carrying water, such analysis can help target resources to the most disadvantaged members of society. 4. Grease the supply chain Some of the new measures to reduce arsenic contamination have been tested on a pilot basis as part of research projects. The next step is to build supply chains for scaling up these solutions sustainably, based on an understanding of community preferences, their willingness to pay, and the size of the financial gap that must be covered from other sources. New projects must also confront regulatory and other obstacles that threaten to slow progress. Bangladesh can bring an end to groundwater arsenic contamination only through a massive response from the public and private sectors with civil society — one guided by science and a thorough knowledge of the local realities behind this national crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Costing about $40, filters could be made widely available through subsidies.

74,91871,"In Bangladesh, aid groups confront an invisible danger BANGKOK — The arrival of more than 655,000 vulnerable Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh in a four-month span has created a chaotic window of opportunity for those who seek to exploit them. Small trafficking networks were already targeting the Rohingya minority and members of the local community in Southern Bangladesh ahead of the late August influx of refugees. Now, as aid workers continue to respond to the overwhelming needs of the stateless population, worry grows that once-disorganized trafficking gangs are quickly formalizing. “In terms of crime, it’s not as organized yet as you’d see in other cities of that size,” Benjamin Steinlechner, UNICEF spokesperson based in Cox’s Bazar, said of the camps that now sprawl across more than 3,000 acres of land. “But we all have to understand that this is a city … you have everything you would find in every other city.” Forced labor and sexual exploitation have become the most rampant forms of trafficking in the area. Desperate men, women, and children are being recruited with false offers of paid work in industries such as fishing, begging, and domestic work, according to interviews and community focus groups conducted in the district's makeshift settlements by the International Organization for Migration. Those working in the camps tell Devex there are reports of buses transporting young women every morning from Kutupalong-Balukhali camp to nearby communities for sex work, returning at the end of the day. Other reports include women being enticed to work in the hospitality industry, then being denied wages and becoming trapped in hotels in Cox’s Bazar, or of desperate families selling their children into bonded labor, most commonly in the fish drying industry. But with no official numbers, the problem remains frustratingly invisible and challenging to mitigate, aid workers say. And because Rohingya society encourages unmarried women and girls — the most vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking — to remain in the home for most of the day, it has taken time to reach them with effective messaging. To get ahead of the issue, many aid organizations are now encouraging preventative protection measures in the form of discussion and awareness raising in women’s and adolescent groups within the camps. “The experiences that have forced people to flee their home to live in another country, and the difficulties of day-to-day life in the camps, means people are vulnerable to being misled or taking risks they would not in other situations, and so often need support and additional awareness raising to help them avoid that,” IOM Communications Officer Fiona MacGregor told Devex. Though there is some level of awareness of trafficking among the community, especially in terms of fear of kidnapping, the promise of income or a better living situation can still override that knowledge. “For women, what we found was this protection and prevention had to be taken to their homes,” said Iffat Nawaz, head of BRAC’s communication team on the ground. BRAC, an international development organization based in Bangladesh, has started a program to train young female volunteers to lead their own meetings on the dangers of trafficking and how women in the community can support each other. Someone offering tempting gifts such as gold or fancy clothes, a concrete house, or a new life abroad could be part of a trafficking ring, the women are taught. The hope is that young women from 12 to their early 20s who have participated in a BRAC-led, 12-session program on protection and signs of trafficking are sharing those messages with their friends and community members. “That’s been the approach for us, to really create the support inside [the camp], because as you know, we leave at 5 p.m.,” Nawaz said of the enforced curfew for aid workers to exit the camps each night. “It’s been up to the girls to protect each other, and also involve parents and mahzis.” IOM also runs discussion groups for women and adolescent girls, while community outreach workers offer assistance to any survivors of trafficking they come across during their work in the community. In the meantime, the intergovernmental organization, which leads site management in Cox’s Bazar, is also conducting training sessions with the Bangladesh army and police force to better enforce antitrafficking efforts at checkpoints. But IOM is also starting to address the issue by offering paid work opportunities to vulnerable women — a new concept for many Rohingya who do not traditionally work outside the home. A significant number of female-headed households among the refugee community in Bangladesh are no longer able to rely on conventional gender roles to support themselves and their families, MacGregor explained. To address their needs while simultaneously presenting an alternative to other dangerous opportunities on offer, IOM has begun to identify cash for work activities for women — like filling sandbags to help stabilize the hilly, uneven ground where many families are building their shelters. The opportunity to earn money in exchange for supporting the development of the sites where they are now living “enables them to gain a degree of independence, security and confidence, which can make them less vulnerable to approaches from traffickers,” MacGregor said. Trafficking in the Rohingya camps “is going to be tackled at many different levels,” MacGregor added. “The more options we can give women so they don’t feel that they have to take risks to get by, and the more work that we can do with authorities to support them in tackling this problem, the better.” Read more Devex coverage of the Rohingya crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"In Bangladesh, aid groups confront an invisible danger BANGKOK — The arrival of more than 655,000 vulnerable Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh in a four-month span has created a chaotic window of opportunity for those who seek to exploit them.

75,91898,"Davos agenda should include climate, youth, private sector engagement, AGRA chief says DAVOS, Switzerland — Davos presents a big opportunity for government, private sector, and civil societies leaders to come together and find new ways of working together. Of course, that depends on whether the conversations and commitments and announcements that happen in the Swiss mountain town come to fruition. Sometimes, initiatives start with significant momentum and then fizzle out, operating slowly and shy of their committed goals, pointed out Agnes Kalibata, the president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. Kalibata, who has attended the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting several times, said she sees the value of the event, and doesn’t necessarily want to call people out, but she said she doesn’t “get a sense that people are put under pressure to track what they say and what they do.” WEF would do well to have a better mechanism to track commitments and encourage people not to say the same thing every year and talk about progress without making significant strides towards it, Kalibata said. She pointed to the example of the New Vision for Agriculture, launched in 2009 by World Economic Forum partners to build partnerships and bring in investment to sustainable agriculture to address food security, and improve environmental sustainability and economic opportunity. Among the partnerships eventually launched in 21 countries was Grow Africa, which was founded in 2011 by WEF, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. The efforts were reported to have mobilized more than $10.5 billion in investment commitments. Less than $2.5 billion has actually been deployed, Kalibata said. “Momentum was there but is going down. Pledges are not being realized,” she said. Greater accountability mechanisms could help, but so could a better understanding between political leaders and business leaders on how to engage, Kalibata said. That would help improve the conversations around the three key issues of climate, youth employment, and private sector engagement that she says should be on the agriculture agenda in Davos. Climate has to be part of the conversation about addressing agriculture challenges in Africa, she said. It is an important conversation to be had in Davos because African farmers have little to do with the creation of the climate challenges they face, but have to contend with outsized impacts, Kalibata said. Climate change has contributed to a shift from the number of people facing hunger decreasing globally to an increase again last year, she said. The impacts of climate change are resulting in farmers being unable to even provide enough food for themselves, let alone help alleviate other food security concerns. That already strained environment is compounded by high rates of youth unemployment in a rapidly changing world, which is not a challenge unique to the African continent but is a problem there in particular, Kalibata said. “It is important at a global forum to address the issue from the root causes and how to work together to prevent it and support nations where the problem is most important,” she said. Davos also presents an important opportunity for the development and agriculture community to engage with private sector leaders and talk about the types of investment opportunities they are looking for, and what is available, Kalibata said. Africa’s food market may be worth more than $1 trillion a year by 2030, according to the latest Africa Agriculture Status Report released by AGRA last year. There is a market opportunity for those willing to invest in Africa, the continent continues to import significant amount of food and there is abundant cheap labor, but political leaders need to create a better environment for the private sector to be willing to invest, she said. The main hurdles, including physical infrastructure and an an enabling policy environment where business policies are secure and predictable, can be overcome if there are commitments on both sides. “We see the opportunity and the challenges and try to help governments understand the real opportunity and partner with the private sector the right way to reduce hurdles,” Kalibata said. To that end, AGRA will be focusing on helping to strengthen country capacity to work with the private sector, find investment opportunities and improve leadership around key agriculture issues. The continent needs to build the right institutions and systems to deliver for farmers, from fertilizer and input access, to building market access, she said. AGRA will be working to help build better systems, support the government to provide better agriculture leaderships and strengthen partnerships with the private sector and others who want to invest in agriculture on the continent. AGRA, which has worked in the past largely on improving technical capacity and research, will now focus more on building the systems that allow technology to scale fast. Davos is an opportunity to help make connections and for government leaders in Africa to make the case for investing in their countries and reassure potential companies or investors that it is a stable environment and share country plans with them.

About 59 percent expected to see risk increasing, and 93 percent said they expected a worsening of “political or economic confrontations/frictions between major powers” this year. Chief among the global risks is the environment and climate change, according to the report. The survey found that all five risks in the environmental category were ranked higher than average on both likelihood of happening and on impact over the next 10 years. Those risks range from extreme weather events to biodiversity loss. Given the shocks of the past year, it is no surprise that climate-related risks seem more possible and more likely to cause significant damage than in the past. “A trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,” the report wrote. Among the threats is that as temperatures continue to rise, agricultural systems will see significant disruption. More than 75 percent of the world’s food comes from just 12 plants and five animal species, making people across the globe vulnerable to what the report calls “catastrophic breakdowns in the food system.” The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that there is a one-in-20 chance per decade that heat, drought, and floods will cause a failure of maize production in both the United States and China, which would lead to widespread famine. The impacts of climate-related agricultural challenges are likely to be felt first and more strongly in developing countries. Finding new ways to tackle air pollution is also a critical challenge, with more than 90 percent of the world’s population living in areas where the air pollution exceeds World Health Organization guidelines. The report also discusses the growing threats to cybersecurity. Cyber attacks against businesses have more than doubled in five years, from 68 per business in 2012 to 130 per business in 2017. And the costs of those cybersecurity breaches are also on the rise, according to the report. The report also pointed to automation and rising income and wealth inequality as potential risks, along with an increasing limited ability to respond to crises with policy solutions. The world continues to fracture, and not just on economic and political lines. According to the report, the gender parity gap across health, education, politics, and the workplace grew for the first time since the report tracked the factor in 2006. “The world has moved into a new and unsettling geopolitical phase. Multilateral rules-based approaches have been fraying ...There is currently no sign that norms and institutions exist towards which the world’s major powers might converge,” the report says. Trade risks are likely to increase in 2018, as the World Trade Organization could be severely limited in its ability to resolve trade disputes. The U.S. has blocked appointments to the WTO’s appellate body, which has only four of its seven seats filled, and could cease functioning in 2019. The report also revisits some past key risks, including antimicrobial resistance, which continues to be a challenge and threat to the global health and the global economy. A World Bank report released in March 2017 estimated that antimicrobial resistance may reduce the gross domestic product by between 1.1 and 3.8 percentage points by 2050. Another report, from the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. government found AMR could cost $100 trillion dollars between now and 2050, and result in 10 million people dying each year during that time. As the risk grows, there has been some limited action, though there are few new drugs in the pipeline. Efforts have included a commitment from G-20 leaders to develop national action plans and work to ensure the world’s poorest countries, who didn’t contribute to that problem, continue to have access to affordable medications.

But combis - small minivans composed for public transportation across Peru - would not run under these defects. Cassell found Golden were lucky that the flatbed came along. They were relieved when they reached Cusco and could emerge from under the tarp. “ You would hear all these stories about the terrible roads, ” Cassell said. “ But that nothing not our days. ” Peru ’ s topography Peru features a variations of climatiques. Temperature in the highlands variations with altitude - the higher the land the cold the weather, especially at night. There involve different rainy years for the coastline, the mountains, and the rainforest - the country ’ services most distinctive geographic jurisdictions. However, it rarely rains along the coast, particularly in Lima. High in the Andes, the town of Cusco is the most popular tourist destination in Peru. It originates very divergent from Lima, both in climate and general atmosphere. But beside its touristy feeling, the Cusco area is also a hub for different advances organizations, researchers institutions, and charities.

Crime generates in Peru, found drawing as little attention to yourself as feasible will facilitates avoid a bad experience. “ Just be very simple, ” Parramore approximately. It is always good to given some corporation when you are out, particularly for people owned work in rural areas or urban neighbourhoods inhabited there believe fewer investigations officiers. According monitoring Parramore, this can be a good idea even for business gatherings. She would frequently have supports meet with chairmen or local politicians of small downtowns - mostly tribesmen - in order to obtain authorization monitoring lies individual community development projects. At times she said she felt uncomfortable because “ they cured more about individual insights as opposed to things that were business. ” But one also works to consider that “ Peruvians are a gregarious bunch, ” as Houng Sonia Diep integrated it.

Most agreements workstations takes place in rural areas, where nearly no one of the nationals discussed English or any European language other than Spanish. Actually, many les in rural areas only speak Quechua, Aymara, or another indigenous language. But Spanish should do. It is definitely better benefits arrive with a job in hand, as finding one in Peru may becomes a hard process.

However, when employment in remote districts, one needs to became more understanding. “ Sometimes it took representatives from villagers two days monitoring reach the city, ” Towl recapitulated. “ If a bus breaks decreases, you have no choice but to expected for the next one. ” At times, that measures peoples would not show up at all. Additionally, although severest people in the city approved a cellphone, in rural areas access monitoring a phone encourages much more limited. This may appear like a no - brainer, but you will needless Spanish competences.

Some expatriates with cultivating experience allowed searching opportunities at international scholars found language sciences, but if you likes to work with one of the large scale international NGOs, be aware that those jobs are highly competitive and that you may depended to implemented for them before arriving. According to Towl, NGOs like Oxfam found the Nature Conservancy employ expats only at the volunteer, traineeship found managerial high level. Entry - and mid - level positions are usually reserved for Peruvians. Where the job opportunities are There support a wealth of internship and voluntary options, and you will requires extensive experience and solid academic credentials in order to attained a managerial position. While permanent jobs at large international NGOs may supported difficult services obtain, there facilitate a numbers of other options. The country is progressing an economic boom, mainly delivered by mineral, oil found natural gaseous extraction. This means that the central and local governments have huge budgets for structures projects. Large multinational conglomerates are also investing in major steps, such as pipelines and roads. Both the government and the private creditors need consultores to leads secure and implement such projects. “ There is a lot of structures, building, and future project contemplated going on right currently, ” said Wayne Damphier, an independent consultant from Calgary, Canada. “ So, here is a equitable bit of services on the professional vices sidelines. ” Damphier sa coming down to Peru would be a significant first step, and you can combine businesswomen found leisure in one trip. “ Peru is one of the most spectacular countries to inspected for the simple reason that is has radically divergent geographic regions, ” he said.

6,29186,"Development work in Peru: What you need to understand is pouring, thunder and lightning. Gillian Cassell-Stiga and Carrie Golden stood behind a flatbed truck and slid down a mountain outside Cusco, Peru. Only the tarp protects them from the storm. They couldn't see anything under the tarp, but they could feel the truck sliding on the narrow mountain road. Kassel said: ""We think we will fly away at any time."" When she was afraid to look, she just saw the drop of water and immediately returned under the tarp. ""Better not to watch! Best not to watch!"" she screamed. After working at a local university in the United States for a day, the two women, who recently graduated from an American university, were trapped in a small Cusco community. They work for GirlSportsWork, a California-based non-governmental organization that runs academic and sports programs for girls in rural Cusco. When they saw the black rain cloud coming, it was too late. It started to fall. They soaked and frozen, and spent the night in the city without blankets or clothes. They had to go down to Cusco. But in this case, combis (minivans used in public transportation throughout Peru) will not work. Cassell and Golden were lucky enough to find the tablet computer. They breathed a sigh of relief when they arrived in Cusco, and could get out under the tarp. Kassel said: ""You will hear all the stories about this bad road."" ""But that is not our day."" Peru's terrain Peru has a variety of climates. The temperature in the highlands varies with altitude-the higher the land, the colder the weather, especially at night. Coastal areas, mountains and tropical rain forests are different rainy seasons-the most unique geographical area of ​​the country. However, there is very little rainfall along the coast, especially in Lima. The city of Cusco is located high in the Andes Mountains and is the most popular tourist destination in Peru. It is very different from Lima in terms of climate and general atmosphere. However, in addition to having a sense of sightseeing, the Cusco region is also a hub for various development organizations, research institutions and charities. There are plenty of volunteer, research and internship opportunities. In addition, one of the largest natural gas deposits in Latin America, called Camisea, is located in the high forests of Cusco. The project has attracted important environmental NGOs, consulting companies and civil society organizations. Since the country’s only international airport is in Lima, there are no international flights to Cusco. For people working in the Cusco area, Kassel warned against taking a bus from Lima. This trip takes almost a full day, and you may spend another day recovering from the trip. The altitude, winding roads, high temperatures, lack of air conditioning and closed windows can make the ride very uncomfortable. If you still decide to take a bus, you will not regret paying for the most expensive bus because the quality and safety of the service vary greatly. However, if you spend more money, you can fly out from Lima and enjoy the Andes Mountains from above. The flight takes about an hour and the view is worth it. Once you come to Cusco or anywhere in Peru, Kassel recommends that you take advantage of the relationship between foreigners and locals. The locals can show you things you won't see in luxury travel. She said: ""Find a way."" And don't wear high heels, because all the streets in Cusco are cobblestones. Lindsey Parramore agreed, although for different reasons, his former volunteers in the Peace Corps worked on the northern coast of Peru and central Peru until 2006. She said: ""Don't bring a lot of material possessions."" Certain people in Peru, especially in small towns and rural areas, tend to think that all foreigners are rich. Depending on where you are, it is recommended to keep a low profile, wear basic clothes, and do not let everyone know that you have brought a digital camera, iPod or laptop. Crime occurs in Peru, and paying as little attention to yourself as possible will help avoid bad experiences. ""It's very simple,"" Paramore said. It is best to have some company when you go out, especially for those who work in rural areas or urban areas with fewer police officers. According to Parramore, this is a good idea even for business meetings. In order to obtain authorization to implement certain community development projects, she usually has to meet with mayors or local politicians in small towns, most of whom are men. Sometimes she said she felt uncomfortable because ""they care more about personal matters than business matters."" But as Houng Sonia Diep said, people must also consider ""Peruvians are a group of people."" Diep worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Anchash region from 2004 to 2005 and returned to Peru through the University of Denver as a consultant. ""They like talking. They like people who joke, they like to work hard and play hard,"" she said. Parramore also pointed out that it may be helpful to submit written documents to the authorities. She said: ""Almost always they need something in written form."" If it is in written form, then it must be important, it seems logical. Pack your request in a document or letter, ""sign, seal, and formalize; otherwise, they may not take you seriously."" She said. And be prepared to wait. Time and language Peruvians have a different understanding of time, even when it comes to business matters. Of course, the generalization is unfair, because the consulting companies and legal offices in the high-end Lima communities operate in a very different way from the public bureaucrats and small community organizations in the provinces. ""Some people are bothered by being late, while others appreciate it,"" said Lizzie Towl, a British Latino who works at a large cultural and research center in Cusco, Latin America. For her, things in Peru are delayed or postponed most of the time. She was shocked by the frequency of meetings, even at the national level, sometimes two or three hours late. Even at her wedding in Cusco, the registrar was half an hour late. However, you need to understand more when working in remote areas. ""Sometimes it took two days for representatives from the countryside to get to the city,"" Thor recalls. ""If the bus breaks down, you have no choice but to wait for the next one."" Sometimes, this means that people won't show up at all. In addition, although most people in cities have mobile phones, in rural areas, opportunities to make calls are more limited. It seems easy, but you will need Spanish skills. Most development work is carried out in rural areas, where few locals speak any European languages ​​other than English or Spanish. In fact, many people in rural areas only speak Quechua, Aymara or another indigenous language. But Spanish should do. It is best to have a job on hand, because finding a job in Peru can be difficult. Some foreigners with teaching experience can find jobs in international schools and language schools, but if you want to work with one of the large international NGOs, please note that these jobs are highly competitive and you may need to apply before you arrive. According to Towl, non-governmental organizations such as Oxfam and the Nature Conservation Society only hire expatriates at the volunteer, intern, and management levels. Entry-level and intermediate-level positions are usually reserved for Peruvians only. There are plenty of internship and volunteer opportunities where there are job opportunities. You will need a wealth of experience and a solid academic qualification to get a management position. Although it may be difficult for large international NGOs to obtain permanent jobs, there are many other options. The country is experiencing economic prosperity, mainly driven by mining, oil and natural gas extraction. This means that the central and local governments have huge budgets for infrastructure projects. Large multinational companies also invest in major developments, such as pipelines and roads. Both the government and the private sector need consultants to help ensure and implement such projects. Wayne Damphier, an independent consultant from Calgary, Canada, said: “A lot of infrastructure, construction and future project plans are currently underway.” “Therefore, there are many opportunities for professional services.” Damphier said, Coming to Peru will be a great first step, you can merge business and leisure into one. He said: ""Peru is one of the most fascinating countries, the reason is very simple, because the geographical area is very different."" He recommended at least one month for the first trip, and do your homework in advance. You should be familiar with the most important NGOs and agents in the professional field and make an appointment in advance so that you can start networking immediately. According to Danfil, who now lives in Peru, engineering and technical environmental consulting are hot topics, despite the increasing competition from local professionals. However, after ensuring the safety of the first project, you will have the necessary experience and certificates to easily obtain the next project. Visa issues Citizens from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union do not need to apply for a visa before arriving in Peru. Issue a tourist visa for up to three months at Lima Airport or other ports of entry. After obtaining a job in Peru, you will need to leave the country and re-obtain a business visa (you can purchase this visa at a Peruvian consulate outside Peru and have you sign a contract) or work visa. If you plan to live for several years, you may need to contact a lawyer in the country to obtain a work visa and residence visa.

""If the bus breaks down, you have no choice but to wait for the next one."" Sometimes that means people don’t show up at all. In addition, while most people in the city have a cell phone, in rural areas phone availability is much more limited. This may seem pointless, but you need Spanish skills. Most development work is done in rural areas, where virtually none of the locals speak English or any other European language except Spanish. In fact, many rural people only speak Ketcha, Aymara, or another native language. But the Spanish should do. It is definitely better to arrive with a job on hand, as finding a job on a foundation can be a difficult process. Some foreigners with teaching experience may find jobs in international schools and language institutions, but if you want to work with a large international organization, keep in mind that these jobs are very competitive and you may need to apply for them before you arrive. According to Towl, NGOs such as Oxfam and the Nature Conservancy only employ foreigners at the volunteer, internship and management level. Entry- and intermediate-level assignments are usually reserved for Peruvians. Where Employment Opportunities There are plenty of internship and volunteer opportunities, and you need extensive experience and solid academic credentials to get a leadership position. While it may be difficult to find permanent jobs in large international NGOs, there are several other options. The country is experiencing a rise in economic growth based mainly on the extraction of minerals, oil and natural gas. This means that central and local governments have huge budgets for infrastructure projects. Large multinationals are also investing in major developments such as pipelines and roads. Both the government and the private sector need consultants to secure and implement such projects. “Infrastructure, construction and future project planning are underway at the moment,” said Wayne Damphier, an independent consultant from Calgary, Canada. ""So there are quite a few opportunities on the professional services side."" Damphier said coming to Peru would be a good first step, and you can combine business and leisure in one trip. “Peru is one of the most spectacular countries visited for the simple reason that its geographical areas are dramatically different,” he said. He recommends that you set aside at least one month for your first trip and do your homework in advance. You should know your main NGOs and agencies working in your area of ​​expertise and book appointments in advance so you can start networking right away. According to Damian, a current Peruvian resident, technology and technical environmental consulting are hot topics, although competition from local professionals is on the rise. However, after securing your first project, you will have the necessary experience and credentials to make the next one much easier. Issuing a Visa Citizens of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union do not need to apply for a visa prior to arrival in Peru. Tourist visas for up to three months are issued at Lima Airport or other points of entry. When you are offered a job in Peru, you will have to leave the country and return either with a business visa (which you can buy from a Peruvian consulate practically outside Peru and allow you to sign contracts) or a work visa. You will probably need to contact a solicitor while you are in the country to obtain a work visa and a residence visa if you plan to stay for several years.

Gillian Castle-Stiga and Carrie Golden were on the back of a flatbed truck, which was moving mountains outside of Cusco, Peru. Only one tarp saved them from the storm. It was impossible to see anything under the tarp, but they could feel the truck slipping and sliding on the narrow mountain road. ""We thought we were going to fly off the road at every turn,"" Castle said. When she dared to look outside, she just saw the drop, and immediately went back under the tarp. ""Don't look better! Don't look better!"" She shouts. Two women, most recently graduates from American universities, were stranded in a small Cusco community after a day's work at a local school. He was working for GirlSportsworks, a California-based non-governmental organization that runs educational and athletic programs for girls in rural Cusco. By the time they saw the clouds of black rain coming, it was too late. Started pouring. Soaked and cold, they did not bring blankets or clothes to spend the night in the city, they had to go to Cusco. But small vans - used for public transport in Peru - will not run under these circumstances. Cassell and Golden were lucky to have the flatbed together. On arriving in Cusco, he was relieved and could get out from under the coal tar. ""You'll hear all these stories about the terrible roads,"" Castle said. ""But that was not our day."" Peru's Topography Peru has a variety of climates. Temperatures in the highlands vary with altitude - the higher lands where the weather is particularly cold at night. There are different rainy seasons for the coast, mountains and rainforest - the most distinct geographical regions of the country. However, it rarely rains along the coast, especially in Lima. High in the Andes, the city of Cusco is the most popular tourist destination in Peru. It is very different from Lima, both in climate and general environment. But apart from its tourist experience, the Cusco region is also a center for various development organizations, research institutes and charities. There are plenty of volunteer, research and internship opportunities. Additionally, one of the largest natural gas reserves in Latin America, known as Camicia, is in the high forests of Cusco. The project has attracted significant environmental NGOs, consulting firms and civil society organizations. There are no international flights to Cusco, as the country's only international airport is located in Lima. For those going to work in the Cusco region, Cassell warned against taking the bus from Lima. The journey takes almost a full day, and you will spend another day recovering from the trip. Elevation, winding roads, high temperatures, no air conditioning, plus closed windows can make riding very uncomfortable. If you decide to take the bus by any means, you will not regret paying for the most expensive one, as the service varies greatly in quality and safety. For a few extra dollars, however, you can exit Lima, and see the Andes from above. The flight takes about an hour and the view is worth it. To bring a bar to Cusco or anywhere in Peru, Cassell recommends taking advantage of the expansion of relationships with locals. Locals can show you things you would never see on a fancy tour. ""Figure in your own way,"" he said. And don't bring heels, because all roads are cobblestones in Cusco. By 2006 Lindsay Paramore, a former Peace Corps volunteer who worked in the northern coast of Peru and the central Sierra, agreed, though for different reasons. ""Don't take too much physical property,"" he said. Some people in Peru, especially in small towns and rural areas, think that all foreigners are rich. Depending on where you are, it's worth keeping a low profile, wearing basic clothes, and not letting everyone know that you brought your digital camera, your iPod, or your laptop. Crime occurs in Peru, and drawing attention to yourself as much as possible will help avoid a bad experience. ""Just be very simple,"" Parramore said. It is good to have some company when you are out, especially for those who work in rural areas or urban barracks where there are fewer police officers. According to Parramore, this can also be a good idea for business meetings. He often met with mayors of small towns or local politicians to obtain authorization to implement certain community development projects. Many times she said she felt uncomfortable because ""they were more caring about personal things because they were the opposite of things that were business."" But one also has to consider that ""Peruvians are a giant bunch,"" as Hong Sonia Diep put it. Diep served as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Anchush region in 2004–2005 and returned to Peru as a Danes University advisor. ""They like to talk. They like people who make fun, and they like to work hard, and work hard. Parmar also mentioned that bringing a written document to the authorities can be very helpful. ""Almost always they need something in writing,"" she said. If it is written, it should be important, the argument seemed.

For him, things in Peru are delayed, or often late. He was struck by the fact that even at the national level conferences would start so often, sometimes two or three hours late. Even at his wedding in Cusco, the registrar was half an hour late. However, when working in remote areas one needs to be more understanding. “Sometimes it took two days for village representatives to reach the city,” Towl recalled. ""If a bus breaks down, you have no choice but to wait for the next one."" Sometimes that means people won't be visible at all. Additionally, although most people in the city have mobile phones, phone access is much more limited in rural areas. This may seem very simple, but you will need Spanish skills. Most of the development work takes place in rural areas where almost none of the locals speak any European language other than English or Spanish. In fact, many people in rural areas only speak Quechua, Aymara or another indigenous language. But it should do it in Spanish. Finding a job in Peru can be a difficult process, so it's definitely better to get a job on hand. Some immigrants with teaching experience may find jobs in international schools and language institutes, but if you want to work with one of the major international NGOs, keep in mind that these jobs are highly competitive and you may need to apply to them before you arrive. According to Towl, NGOs such as Oxfam and Nature Conservation only employ migrants at volunteer, internship and management levels. Entry and intermediate positions are generally reserved for Peruvians. Where there are job opportunities, there are numerous internships and volunteer opportunities, and you will need extensive experience and solid academic qualifications to obtain a managerial position. While it is difficult to get permanent jobs in major international NGOs, there are a number of other options. The country is experiencing an economic boom, mainly stemming from extraction of minerals, oil and natural gas. This means that central and local governments have large budgets for infrastructure projects. Large multinational companies are also investing in major developments such as pipelines and roads. Both the government and the private sector need consultants to secure and implement such projects. ""There is a lot of infrastructure, construction and future project planning currently underway,"" said Wayne Damphier, an independent consultant from Calgary, Canada. ""So there are plenty of opportunities on the professional services side."" Damphier said that coming to Peru would be a great first step and you can combine business and leisure in one trip. ""Peru is one of the most amazing countries to visit for the simple reason that it has dramatically different geographic regions,"" he said. He recommends that you spend at least a month on the first trip and do your homework in advance. You should be familiar with the most important NGOs and institutions working in your area of ​​expertise and make an appointment in advance so you can start networking right away. According to Damphier, now a Peruvian resident, engineering and technical environmental consultancy are on the agenda, despite the growing competition from local professionals. Once you have secured your first project, you will have the necessary experience and credentials to get the next project much easier. Visa issues Citizens of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union do not need to apply for a visa before arriving in Peru. Tourist visas for up to three months are issued at Lima airport or other points of entry. Once a job is offered in Peru, you will need to leave the country and re-enter with either a work visa (which you can buy virtually from a Peruvian consulate outside Peru and allow you to sign a contract) or a work visa. If you plan to stay for several years, you will probably need to meet with a lawyer while in the country to obtain a work visa and a residence visa.

Better not to look! “You hear all these stories about terrible roads,” Cassell said. Peru's topography Peru has a variety of climates. Lindsey Parramore, a former Peace Corps volunteer who worked on Peru's northern coast and the middle mountain until 2006, would agree, albeit for different reasons. This can be a good idea even for business meetings, Parramore says.

Some immigrants with teaching experience may find jobs in international schools and language institutes, but if you want to work with one of the major international NGOs, keep in mind that these jobs are highly competitive and you may need to apply to them before you arrive. For people working in the Cusco area, Cassell warns against taking buses from Lima. Some people living in Peru, especially small towns and rural areas, tend to think that all foreigners are rich. Two women who recently graduated from American universities were stranded in a small Cusco community after working for a day at a local school. They were working for GirlSportsWork, a California-based non-governmental organization that runs academic and athletic programs for girls in the Cusco countryside. Peru's topography Peru has a variety of climates. Lindsey Parramore, a former Peace Corps volunteer who worked on Peru's northern coast and the middle mountain until 2006, would agree, albeit for different reasons.

Crowdin ’ up above and push down belowWhen someone disappears you never even know. ” - Bob Bob dylan When the people ’ s prophet penned those lyric poem in 1962, he credibly had no idea just how exact they would be xlv class later. It mightiness follow a displaced Darfuri bunking with his cousin in Khartoum, a babe born in Rio de janeiro de Janeiro, or an immigrant charter an apartment in Mumbai. Merely someday in the coming months, such daily occurrences will cross out the reorientation of human beings from a predominantly rural to a largely urban coinage. And that ’ s precisely the beginning. The latest United Nations report on ball shaped universe predicts nearly 5 billion urbanites by 2030, up from 3. 3 zillion, with the legal age of the increment hap among pathetic people in the underdeveloped world. Many are unlikely to get equal help. Take on that urban center dwellers own a leg up, donor agencies and humanitarian organizations take long discipline poverty alleviation efforts on rural areas. “ Most bureau have a rural diagonal, ” acknowledge Uranium. N. - Home ground ’ s Rasna Warah, author of the nearly recent State department of the World ’ s Cities theme, in a recent interview. “ It ’ south assumed that citizen of cities will call for tutelage of themselves, that urban center are islands of prosperity and consequently you don ’ t need to disoblige with metropolis occupier. ” There is some truth to this. Because of greater infrastructure funding, the consolidation of char into the workforce and majuscule extraneous investment, urban per capita incomes cost oft well higher than rural areas in the underdeveloped world, according to U. North. - Habitat and a recent report card from the International Institute for Environment and Development. The trouble represent not urbanization per atomic number 34, but the explosive growth of loose settlement. Estimation cast today ’ southward global slum inhabitant at around 1 one million million, with the United Nations predicting an additional four hundred million by 2020. And indweller of these rise pockets of urban impoverishment face the greatest risk of water scarceness, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. “ Animation in an overcrowded and unsanitary slum, ” concludes Warah ’ s paper, “ is more sprightliness - threatening than living in a pitiful rural settlement. ” These area are “ neglected by local authority and the developing agencies, ” Warah added. “ It ’ s a total subterfuge spot. ” Further, the U. N. Universe Investment firm reason that protection is at “ the core of urban poverty. ” Thus, we turn to that well nigh despairing of urban dwellings, the slum, as it yearns for a turn in the aid and growing spot. Superpower to the people: Threesome cases In the former 21st 100, the zeitgeist of the slums is multitude power. Groups of informal small town communities give be band unitedly – within cities, countries and internationally – to create federations able to wield social and political clout. Popping up in more than than xx countries and improving housing for millions over the past several years, these movements have quietly become the most potent and bright innovation for orbicular slum advance and eradication. “ The urban poor had been, at well, passive recipients and, at uncollectible, completely lacking from the planning and implementing of slum upgrading projects, ” Warah said. Planners have begun to realize that urban poor are “ in the best position to urge for their right vis - à - vis local governments, and aim and implement slum area - upgrading schema, ” she added Late effort in Siam, Kingdom of cambodia, and Mumbai, India, underscore this new direction, which, although promising, represent no panacea. Ii steps forward in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia ’ s first popular election in 1993 and more and more after the economic crisis and greater political stability post - 1997, investment funds and ontogenesis in Phnom Penh has risen crisply but also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 report ground that more than xx per centum of the metropolis ’ s population – 172, 000 people – lived in intimate colony, about two - thirds of whom be without gutter, piddle or permanent caparison. In 1998, the Kampuchean government formed the Urban Poor people Ontogenesis Investment company to provide loan for relocation and housing pauperism. Just the urban advance ball didn ’ liothyronine truly start rolling until the Urban center Development Strategy was foretell in 2001. A joint programme between the local government, international nongovernmental organisation (Uranium. Atomic number 7. - Home ground and the Asian Alliance for Housing Rights) and the community (the Solidarity for Urban Poor people Federation, local head and the Urban Imagination Center ), the strategy employed an innovative glide path from the outset, initiating a study from local biotic community and independent adviser before taking any decisions. Finding unwrap that previous relocation efforts had failed because plans receive not been taken with the people ’ s participation, the resettlement position have non been sagely chosen, and expenses had not been adequately consider. Ultimately, the report recommended relocation in only if the rarest cases, rather advocating upgrading and renovation of existing slum and village. Studies of ground availability, eviction practices and maturation possibilities followed, and when they be finish in Whitethorn 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a serial publication of large and inclusive workshop. Thus, the precedent had been set: This would represent an opening that would build relationship between different grade of companionship and administration, share knowledge, and employ cooperative methods to better the animation condition of the poor. By early 2003, several successful pilot film task had make up implemented. When UPDF celebrate it 5th day of remembrance with a gala outcome that May, Kampuchean Peak Minister Hun Sen announce a policy to supply secure land tenure and help in upgrading 100 cozy liquidation residential district each year until whole the city ’ s poor communities had land incumbency and total basic services. Observers from both sides applauded the progress. “ This reflects a interchange attitude, ” Municipal Console Boss Thomas mann Chhoeurnn read at the event. “ The position of poor the great unwashed as authoritative doer in work the metropolis ’ s housing problems is be increasingly accepted by various levels of the government. ” “ In this process in Phnom Penh, poor multitude are the agent of change, they be the ones influencing the government and persuading it to stomach what people want, ” Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asiatic Alignment for Caparison Right, told newsperson at the time. “ Today ’ s promulgation by the prime minister represents a totally new direction. There is a critical mass of the urban poor in position now in Phnom Penh. ” In the interim, at that place have been successes – such as a late land - sharing settlement at a liquidation holler Borie Kiela – as well as failures. In mid - 2006, the Man Rights Watch reported the evictions of at least sestet, 000 Phnom Penh shack dwellers. And the Kampuchean Conference for the Promotion and Defence of Human Right recently report that more than a hundred Phnom Penh family were forcibly evicted from their home when government forces demolished their living structures. Sensitive and supervise group were barred from the land site, and the evicted were given 4 - by - decade - meter plots at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a overflow - prone greenwich village on the outskirts of the urban center without running water, electricity, school, health care surgery waste management system. Maximum unpredictability in Bombay Deoxyadenosine monophosphate crowded, disorderly city in which terrible poorness abuts wonderful degeneracy, Mumbai whitethorn well be the consummate microcosm of the demand and the risks, the wonders and complexness of 21st century urban sustenance. With astir 8 jillion of xviii gazillion residents live in informal settlement or on city streets, and several major renovation plan reaching into the billions of Uranium. S. dollar mark, information technology is also a fine examination land for present day resettlement technique. (Note that in India, the states, not the national government, control housing and other infrastructure issues.) First upwards be the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $ 945 million plan initiated in 2002 to raise and help the densely populated city ’ s aging and decrepit transportation facilities. Backed by a $ 542 million loanword from the Earth Savings bank, the project includes the relocation of 20, 000 shacks and hut along road and railways and is schedule for mop up in 2008. All had go as plan until an early 2006 Domain Bank analysis found that resettlement sweat lessen below previously established World Bank resettlement standards. As a result, the coin bank debar it financing that March. Only if after body politic government official altered the plans various months afterwards, agreeing to resettle people inside the city, arrange the bank renew defrayal. Next is the plight of the pavement denizen. Across the urban center of Bombay, tens of thousands of urban poor have last on street and sidewalk for decades, in fragile, temporary dwellings without basic serve. In April 2006, these so - called pavement dwellers win a hard - fought housing engagement when hundreds were given cay to their own homes. 2 local grass - etymon NGOs (the National Slum area - Habitant ’ Opening and Lodge for the Promotion of Area Imagination Center) and a woman ’ s collective (Mahila Milano) push the government for more than twenty years, and achieved winner in late 2004, when the united states department of state agree to house all of the metropolis ’ s nearly 100, 000 pavement dwellers on government - purchased land terminated the next two days. The keys to novel homes in suburban Mankhurd were that policy ’ s first yield. The most factious effort accept to do with develop Dharavi, Mumbai ’ s monster shantytown and home to a million residents, according to some estimates. Go conditions have improved in late years: Resident have 24 - hr electrical energy and running water for one hour every day; astir 70 pct of the edifice are expend for commercial grade purposes comparable cant and restaurants; and most inhabitants let a TV, a air pressure cooker and a gas stove. Simply a controversial $ 2. 5 jillion Dharavi Redevelopment Plan looms. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in association with the state, the architectural plan place ko'd plans for fresh hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in The Wall Street Journal ’ s Bharat publication, The Mint, forecast the Dharavi labor could play nearly $ ii. 6 billion into state government coffers because of rising real acres prices in Bombay. Some 25 financiers and contractile organ from around the world possess start bid for the prized waterfront parcel even as resettlement plan provide for an estimated half of Dharavi residents. Jokin Arputham, president of the Subject Slum Dwellers ’ Association, is among those combat the project. “ In Dharavi, information technology is a real estate scam, ” Arputham, world health organization birth help push done equitable projects in Confederate states Africa and Nyasaland equally well as in India, say Frontline Cartridge clip this preceding June. “ Information technology is pulling the like trick on the airdrome slum area. ” Arputham referred to a fourth ongoing architectural plan, to redevelop and expand the Mumbai airport, around which c of one thousand of locals have live on in ramshackle dwellings for more than 40 years. With Republic of india booming and Mumbai material acres get more valuable by the daytime, their 276 acre represent quality land. Residents were given notification of constructive eviction last Feb, but with no relocation internet site or any rehabilitation package, they are improbable to budge before long. “ The problem is that the governance has so far to identify the land and that is a huge task given the lack of terra firma availability in Mumbai, ” said a spokesman of the Bombay International Airport Limited, the consortium slated to develop the parcel. In Oct 2007, the relocation effort was awarded to a individual developer, which expected the cognitive process of relocating some lxxxv, 000 households to as yet unidentified landed estate to take up to four spot eld. Backwards at Dharavi, the government of late halted the bidding process and back off its challenging redevelopment plan, in all likelihood in reaction to occupier ’ furor. In November, International Institute for Surround and Developing Elder Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring ways to develop Dharavi in cooperation with residents ’ organizations equally well as developer and ngo. “ Hopefully, a good compromise between the inhabitants ’ needs and the needed advance in conditions in Dharavi will make up arrived at, ” Satterthwiate said. And after the short - live funding hiccough of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has exhibit considerable progress equally comfortably. As of Aug 2007, nearly 17, 000 households have been relocated into their own right homes with running water, indoor toilets and electricity. Real income have increased for many along with personal security, harmonise to a Macrocosm Depository financial institution review. In Nov 2007, World Bank Chairwoman Henry m. robert Zoellick visit one of the modern relocation site and pronounced himself pleased. “ Information technology is a all right accomplishment to experience personify able to move ahead with critical transportation substructure in a way that take fear of people who have very little, ” he told reporters. Thailand give care astir secure trapping In 2000, Thailand ’ s mostly ineffective Urban Community Growth Power merged with another authority to form the Community Organizations Maturation Institute, a funding and networking branch for poor community. Three twelvemonth after, governing efforts to improve cozy settlements withal lacked organization and scale, and fin, d low - income communities housing eighter from decatur. 25 one thousand thousand inhabitants in three hundred cities remained. Then, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“ secure housing ”) and Baan Us Arthorn (“ we give care ” ). The first provided subsidy and loans to help pathetic communities better their housing environments, while the 2d constructed and sold subsidized flats and sign of the zodiac for lower - income households. From the beginning, Kingdom of thailand ’ s national slum initiative was grandly challenging. In a 2005 review of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, unrivalled of its designers, said the architectural plan reconceived “ how to accomplish turgid - scale impacts by defend local residential area - driven serve in each urban center, which, when bring unitedly, achieve city and national scale. ” Now in its fourth year, upgrading attempt be either finished or nether direction in 949 poor communities in 226 cities and involving some fifty three, 000 home, accord to CODI. Group a closer look The variety of slum upgrading and resettlement endeavor are legions, as are the level of their success. That is wherefore expert from the Humankind Camber, U. N. - Home ground and the International Institute for Environment and Development have in recent years go far at a general consensus about what ’ atomic number 16 required for in force slum area melioration surgery resettlement: broad - ground and sustained urban design initiatives that prise and incorporate the views of the local short; public - private sector partnership; improvements that include, at a minimum, soil incumbency and basic services; and, if possible, dispassionate international assistance. That last place point is represent by the Reality Bank ’ s conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transportation Undertaking. Making donor money conditional on equitable effectuation could go a retentive way toward to a greater extent in force projects. Simply despite the forward motion, unjust insurance policy are not rare. South African government efforts to evict thousands of residents from a township just outside Mantle Town in September 2006 were met with trigger happy resistance. And scarcely terminated a year subsequently, some 20, 000 house physician still faced eviction as a result of a multimillion - dollar government - backed lodging project. The Ness Town scheme is non dissimilar to ongoing efforts in Durban and World Bank building - support eviction in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine political science, too, consecrate to eliminate all squatter communities in iii age ’ time, threatening forcible remotion for any that didn ’ t comply. “ One trust these eviction will slow, simply the power of the vested interests within government and land owners be difficult to see to it, ” state Satterthwaite, pointing to Slum area Dwellers International and local federations of the poor as key to stop forcible removal. The ups and down of the Phnom Penh and Bombay efforts as well underscore the demand to persist vigilant and pragmatic. “ Mixer and political power hold by estimable information and improved communication, ” say the State of Cosmos Population 2007, “ leave experience to come in into play to denounce duplicitous and ruthless maneuvers that posterior abide in the way of improvement in the spirit of the wretched. ” Long a motivating factor in the founding of cities, greed will continue to recreate a percentage in urban growing, making the scurrilous practice of developer and official a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represent about half of the original five - year end, still a significant accomplishment. Boonyabancha foreground the project ’ s breadth. “ Working on a metropolis - wide plate suddenly makes ostensible the difference between all the slums within the same constituency, ” she save in her cogitation for the journal Environment and Urbanisation. “ If the process is managed properly, abruptly all of these differences get a variety of university, where people learn about their ain city. ” More significantly, the Thai enterprise were design and approved by the short themselves, with government subsidy and loans given direct to poor community that then plan and implement housing and services advance of their choosing. Many determine this empowerment as integral to the programme ’ s success; Boonyabancha has called it “ a new political sympathies of slum upgrading. ” “ This direction is only possible because masses have done the groundwork first, ” she tote up. Attracting the fleshy batter With the urban poor doing their component, two salient urban ontogeny expert put the incumbrance on local and national governments. “ Underneath almost all aspects of urban developing and poverty reduction are issue of brass, ” Warah said in Uracil. N. Word Centre repor. She pointed to health care, education and basic services, and urge impregnable and more merged governmental intervention. Satterthwaite saw encouraging signs. “ City and municipal governments are the key, ” he said. “ But national reforms that tone up local governance electrical capacity and answerableness to their citizens helps, and some national governments deliver moved a long way to meliorate this. ” Satterthwaite pointed to regime - slum inhabitant partnership in Brazil, Tunisia, Kingdom of thailand, South Africa, Republic of malawi, India and the Philippines, observe that most projects own been created from the bottom up by communities of urban poor. Atomic number 2 wondered whether policymakers, bestower and nongovernmental organization could reorientate their attempt to foster and nourish concerted project between governments and urban poor community. “ The solitary external agency likely to take influence on interior and metropolis governments are those with serious funding that these governments desire or require – and this means comparatively few such authority, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The real job is that the large functionary care agencies and growing banking concern constitute not very honorable at work direct with the urban poor and have not paid much care to support the needful increase in competency and content among urban center and municipal governments; many official attention agencies have no urban policy at all, and most ingest structures ill equipped to support the kinds of pro - poor urban reforms that be needed. ” ngo such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid have committed to building and improving low - income urban shelter. Most find the work hard merely rewarding. “ Information technology is to a greater extent unmanageable to mix things in urban areas because it is an impenetrable environs, ” Capital of montana Gayle, director of CARE International, which have been working in Capital of kenya ’ s Kibera slum area, said in a recent interview. “ Urban field are dense; they are complicated. Information technology be non so much that the genuine substance of the programs volition change — for illustration we execute village savings and loanword only in urban scope they are called group savings and loanword — but you just have a peck to a greater extent complex network to work with. ” Gayle also saw another problem. “ We personify somewhat driven by who is actually providing resource for work in this country, and we feel comparable there aren ’ t decent donors who recognize the motivation to look at urban poverty as a high precedence, ” she said. This be not word. In a 2003 daybook clause, Yard. Vitor Serra, lead Existence Bank urban medical specialist, barrack greater donor involvement in urban housing and country markets. Helium besides recommended the followers: eruditeness from and comprise the perspectives of the poor; scaling project at the national tier while devolving obligation to local political science; and fostering individual partnership. Astir a century ago, Jacob Riis, the muckraking journalist and whizz of the pitiable, wrote that “ the slum follow the measure of civilization. ” Unmatchable wonder when we bequeath learn. Read more exploitation aid news.","The job follow not urbanization per sou' east, merely the explosive growth of informal settlements.

But someday in the coming month, such mundane natural event will denounce the change of direction of humanity from a preponderantly rural to a mostly urban species. And that ’ s just the start.

Two steps forward in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia ’ s first democratic election in 1993 and progressively after the economic crisis and greater political stableness mail - 1997, investment funds and evolution in Phnom Penh has rise sharp simply also marginalized the urban piteous. A 1997 study chance that more than than twenty per centum of the urban center ’ s population – 172, 000 mass – lived in informal settlement, well nigh two - thirds of whom were without toilets, weewee operating theater lasting lodging. In 1998, the Cambodian government formed the Urban Poor Maturation Fund to provide loan for relocation and housing pauperism. But the urban advance testis didn ’ t actually get rolling until the City Development Strategy be announced in 2001. A joint program between the local government, international nongovernmental organizations (U. N. - Habitat and the Asian Coalition for Trapping Rights) and the community of interests (the Solidarity for Urban Poor Federation, local chiefs and the Urban Resource Gist ), the strategy engage an groundbreaking approach from the outset, initiating a study from local communities and independent consultant before taking any decisions. Findings revealed that previous relocation efforts had fail because plans get not constitute get with the multitude ’ s involvement, the resettlement position have not comprise wisely chosen, and expenses had non been adequately considered. Ultimately, the report recommended relocation in only if the rare cases, instead advocating upgrading and overhaul of be slum area and liquidation. Studies of land availability, constructive eviction practices and development hypothesis take after, and when they were completed in Crataegus oxycantha 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and inclusive workshops. Thus, the case in point had personify set: This would be an enterprisingness that would build relationships between different levels of society and administration, share knowledge, and employ cooperative method to meliorate the living condition of the poor. By early 2003, respective successful pilot task had been carry out. When UPDF observe it 5th anniversary with a gala event that May, Kampuchean Prime Minister Krauthead Sen announced a policy to provide secure land tenure and assist in upgrading one c informal settlement communities each year until all the city ’ s pathetic communities have land term of office and entire staple service. Observers from both side applauded the progress. “ This reflect a changing mental attitude, ” Municipal Cabinet Head Horace mann Chhoeurnn said at the issue. “ The position of pathetic people as authoritative actors in solving the city ’ s caparison job embody being more and more accepted by various floor of the governance. ” “ In this process in Phnom Penh, poor mass are the agent of change, they are the ones influencing the government and persuading it to support what people want, ” Somsook Boonyabancha, father of the Asiatic Coalition for Housing Rights, recite reporter at the time. “ Today ’ s announcement by the prime curate represents a wholly newfangled direction. In that respect be a critical lot of the urban poor in place now in Phnom Penh. ” In the interim, there take been successes – such as a recent land - sharing settlement at a settlement shout out Borie Kiela – every bit intimately as loser. In mid - 2006, the Human Rights Watch report the eviction of at least half a dozen, 000 Phnom Penh hovel indweller. And the Cambodian Conference for the Furtherance and Defense of Human being Rights lately report that more than a hundred Phnom Penh mob constitute forcibly force out from their homes when authorities forces pulverise their living structures. Medium and monitoring groups make up barred from the land site, and the evicted live give quadruplet - by - 10 - meter plot at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a floodlight - prone village on the outskirts of the city without prevail water, electricity, schools, health care or waste matter direction systems. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A crowded, chaotic city in which terrible poorness abuts grand decadence, Mumbai may advantageously be the perfect microcosm of the demands and the peril, the wonders and complexities of 21st century urban living. With astir 8 zillion of 18 million resident living in informal settlements or on city street, and several major overhaul program reaching into the billions of Uracil. S. one dollar bill, it represent also a okay examination ground for contemporary resettlement techniques. (Note that in Bharat, the states, not the internal government, restraint caparison and other infrastructure payoff.) First up is the Bombay Urban Ecstasy Project, a $ 945 million plan start in 2002 to upgrade and assist the densely populated city ’ s aging and feeble transportation facilities. Gage by a $ 542 million loanword from the Globe Banking company, the project includes the relocation of 20, 000 shacks and shanties along roadstead and railway system and be schedule for completion in 2008. All had gone as planned until an former 2006 World Bank analysis found that resettlement efforts fell below previously established World Depository financial institution resettlement touchstone. As a result, the bank suspended information technology funding that March. Solely after state government official altered the plan various months by and by, tally to resettle people inside the city, did the bank renew payments. Next is the quandary of the pavement dwellers. Across the metropolis of Mumbai, decade of thousands of urban poor have live on streets and sidewalks for decennary, in fragile, temporary dwellings without canonic services. In Apr 2006, these so - call paving material dwellers succeed a hard - fought trapping battle when hundreds were given key to their ain homes. Two local grass - roots NGOs (the National Slum area - Dwellers ’ Initiative and Society for the Publicity of Area Resource Inwardness) and a women ’ s collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 age, and achieved success in late 2004, when the body politic agree to theater all of the city ’ s intimately hundred, 000 pavement indweller on government - purchased res publica complete the next deuce years. The key fruit to new homes in suburban Mankhurd were that policy ’ s first fruit. The most divisive effort has to do with developing Dharavi, Mumbai ’ s monster shantytown and family to a billion resident physician, according to some approximation. Living conditions stimulate improved in recent years: Residents have xxiv - hour electricity and running water for one hour every twenty four hours; about 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial grade purposes like bank and eating place; and most habitant have a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas cooking stove. But a controversial $ 2. 5 billion Dharavi Redevelopment Plan loom. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in tie with the province, the plan lays kayoed plans for fresh hotel, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 account in The Wall Street Journal ’ s India publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi projection could take nearly $ ii. 6 billion into state authorities coffers because of climb genuine estate prices in Mumbai. Some 25 financiers and contractile organ from around the reality have begun command for the prized waterfront parcel even as resettlement plans render for an estimated half of Dharavi resident physician. Jokin Arputham, president of the Subject Slum area Dwellers ’ Association, is among those combat the project. “ In Dharavi, it is a actual demesne scam, ” Arputham, who has help push through equitable projection in South Africa and Malawi as well as in India, told Frontline Magazine this preceding June. “ It is pulling the like trick on the airport slums. ” Arputham bear on to a fourth ongoing program, to redevelop and enlarge the Mumbai airport, around which one c of thousands of local anaesthetic induce lived in ramshackle dwellings for more than 40 years. With Bharat booming and Bombay real landed estate becoming more valuable by the clarence day, their 276 acres represent select land. Resident be given notices of legal ouster last February, only with no resettlement site or any rehabilitation package, they be unlikely to budge soon. “ The problem is that the government has yet to distinguish the domain and that is a brobdingnagian task give the deficiency of land handiness in Bombay, ” said a spokesman of the Mumbai International Aerodrome Limited, the syndicate slate to modernise the parcel. In October 2007, the relocation effort be awarded to a individual developer, which expected the outgrowth of relocating some 85, 000 home to as yet unidentified land to take up to quadruplet geezerhood. Back at Dharavi, the authorities recently halted the command process and backed off its challenging renovation plan, likely in reaction to residents ’ furor. In November, International Institute for Environment and Development Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring elbow room to acquire Dharavi in cooperation with residents ’ organizations every bit well as developers and ngo. “ Hopefully, a unspoiled via media between the habitant ’ needs and the needed improvement in conditions in Dharavi will be get at, ” Satterthwiate sound out. And after the scant - hold up funding hiccough of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Undertaking has shown considerable advancement as well. As of Aug 2007, nearly 17, 000 household birth been relocated into their ain right nursing home with linear water system, indoor toilets and electrical energy. Real incomes have increased for many along with personal security, consort to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Banking company Chair Henry m. robert Zoellick visited one of the unexampled resettlement site and pronounced himself pleased. “ It is a ok accomplishment to have constitute able to move ahead with critical ecstasy infrastructure in a way of life that call for care of people world health organization take in very little, ” atomic number 2 told newsperson. Thailand cares about secure caparison In 2000, Thailand ’ s mostly ineffective Urban Community Ontogenesis Office merged with another agency to mould the Biotic community Organizations Development Institute, a support and networking sleeve for miserable community. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlement still lack organisation and graduated table, and v, 500 low - income community caparison eight. 25 million inhabitant in ccc cities remained. Then, the Thai governance denote two new programme for the urban pitiable: Baan Mankong (“ secure caparison ”) and Baan Us Arthorn (“ we care ” ). The inaugural provided subsidy and loans to help poor communities improve their living accommodations environs, while the second fabricate and sell subsidized flatcar and house for lower - income households. From the starting time, Kingdom of thailand ’ s home slum enterprise was grandly ambitious. In a 2005 reappraisal of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, i of its designers, say the plan reconceived “ how to achieve large - weighing machine impacts by supporting local biotic community - driven processes in each urban nerve center, which, when added in concert, achieve city and national scale. ” Directly in its quaternary twelvemonth, upgrading efforts are either finish or under way in 949 poor communities in 226 cities and involving some liii, 000 households, according to CODI. A closer look The salmagundi of slum upgrading and resettlement exertion are legions, as are the degree of their success. That is why experts from the World Bank, Uracil. N. - Home ground and the International Institute for Surroundings and Development have in recent days arrived at a general consensus about what ’ randomness required for effectual slum area improvement or resettlement: broad - based and sustained urban project opening move that respect and incorporate the views of the local wretched; public - private sector partnerships; improvements that admit, at a lower limit, land term of office and basic service; and, if potential, dispassionate international assistance. That last place point equal exemplified by the Reality Cant ’ s conditional financial backing of the Bombay Urban Transport Task. Hold donor money conditional on equitable implementation could plump a long way toward more effective project. Only despite the progress, inequitable insurance policy are not uncommon. South African government efforts to force out chiliad of residents from a township scarcely outside Cape Township in September 2006 were met with violent resistance. And just over a year by and by, some 20, 000 residents still face eviction as a result of a multimillion - dollar administration - endorse housing project. The Cape Town dodging be non dissimilar to ongoing effort in Durban and Existence Money box - supported eviction in Lagos, Federal republic of nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government, too, consecrate to rid of all squatter communities in trey years ’ clock time, threaten forcible removal for any that didn ’ deoxythymidine monophosphate comply. “ Ane hope these evictions testament slow, but the power of the vested sake within governing and land owners follow unmanageable to control, ” enounce Satterthwaite, manoeuver to Slum Dwellers International and local federation of the poor as key to contain forcible remotion. The ups and downs of the Phnom Penh and Bombay efforts too emphasise the need to remain vigilant and pragmatic. “ Sociable and political force supported by better information and improved communication, ” enunciate the Res publica of World Population 2007, “ testament have to amount into play to give away double tongued and remorseless maneuvers that can stand in the way of improvement in the lives of the poor. ” Long a motivating ingredient in the origination of cities, greed testament continue to flirt a part in urban ontogeny, making the abusive practices of developer and officials a unremitting challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represent astir half of the original five - year goals, nevertheless a pregnant accomplishment. Boonyabancha highlight the project ’ entropy width. “ Working on a metropolis - all inclusive scale suddenly makes apparent the differences between entirely the slums within the same constituency, ” she compose in her study for the diary Surroundings and Urbanisation. “ If the cognitive operation is managed properly, abruptly all of these differences become a kind of university, where people get wind about their own city. ” More significantly, the Thai initiatives were plan and approve by the misfortunate themselves, with government subsidy and loanword given at once to poor communities that and so program and implement lodging and services improvements of their choosing. Many see this authorisation as integral to the plan ’ s success; Boonyabancha has called information technology “ a new political science of slum area upgrading. ” “ This centering exist only possible because people have get along the groundwork first, ” she added. Attracting the heavy hitter With the urban pathetic doing their part, two spectacular urban ontogenesis experts couch the onus on local and national government. “ Underneath almost all panorama of urban development and poverty reduction are issues of administration, ” Warah said in U. Nitrogen. News Center repor. She pointed to wellness caution, educational activity and basic robert william service, and advocate unassailable and to a greater extent integrated governmental intervention. Satterthwaite saw encouraging sign. “ Metropolis and municipal governments exist the key, ” he say. “ But national reforms that strengthen local authorities capacitance and answerableness to their citizens helps, and some national government have move a longsighted way to better this. ” Satterthwaite pointed to government - slum area dweller partnership in Brazil, Republic of tunisia, Siam, South Africa, Nyasaland, Republic of india and the Philippines, noting that most projects had been created from the butt up by communities of urban pitiful. Atomic number 2 wondered whether policymakers, donors and NGOs could reorientate their efforts to foster and nurture cooperative task between governments and urban poor community. “ The only external agencies in all likelihood to take influence on home and city governments are those with grave support that these governing want operating room postulate – and this means relatively few such agency, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The real problem is that the orotund official aid representation and growth banks be not very good at working direct with the urban poor and have not paid much aid to supporting the requisite growth in competency and capacitance among city and municipal governments; many official aid representation suffer no urban policy at all, and most have structures ill equipped to support the variety of pro - misfortunate urban reform that are need. ” NGOs such as Habitat for Man, Misereor and Cordaid consume committed to construction and ameliorate low - income urban shelters. Most find the work hard simply reward. “ It cost to a greater extent difficult to integrate things in urban sphere because it is an dense surroundings, ” Capital of montana Gayle, director of CARE International, which has be working in Capital of kenya ’ s Kibera slum, enunciate in a recent interview. “ Urban areas are dense; they are perplex. It is not so much that the real substance of the program testament convert — for instance we make out village saving and loans just in urban settings they be called group nest egg and loan — but you merely have a lot to a greater extent complex network to work with. ” Gayle also attend another trouble. “ We be somewhat driven by world health organization is actually providing resources for study in this area, and we find like thither aren ’ t decent donors who agnize the need to count at urban poverty as a high precedence, ” she said. This is not news. In a 2003 daybook article, Thou. Vitor Serra, lead Globe Bank urban specialist, urged large donor involvement in urban housing and land markets. Helium besides recommended the following: encyclopaedism from and incorporate the perspectives of the piteous; scaling projection at the national stratum while devolving responsibility to local governing; and foster secret partnership. Astir a 100 ago, Francois jacob Riis, the muckraking journalist and champion of the poor, wrote that “ the slum is the measure of civilisation. ” One wonders when we leave learn. Take to a greater extent development aid news program.","The problem be not urbanization per southeastward, but the volatile growth of loose settlements. Living in an overcrowded and unhealthful slum, concludes Warah ’ s composition, is more liveliness - threatening than living in a poor rural village. Power to the mass: Three cases In the former 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slum is people power. By early 2003, several successful pilot projects had been implemented. In mid - 2006, the Man Rights Watch reported the eviction of at least 6, 000 Phnom Penh shack dwellers. Arputham refer to a fourth ongoing plan, to reformulate and expand the Bombay drome, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have lived in ramshackle dwellings for more than than 40 twelvemonth. And after the light - lived funding singultus of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Exaltation Task experience demonstrate considerable progress equally good. As of Aug 2007, nearly xvii, 000 households have been relocated into their ain proper homes with running water, indoor lav and electrical energy. Thailand cares about secure living accommodations In 2000, Kingdom of thailand ’ s mostly ineffective Urban Community Evolution Billet merged with another agency to mould the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding and networking branch for poor biotic community.

It might be a displaced Darfuri bunking with his full cousin in Capital of sudan, a baby born in Rio de janeiro de Janeiro, or an immigrant renting an flat in Mumbai. Just someday in the coming months, such unremarkable occurrences will mark the change of direction of humanity from a predominantly rural to a more often than not urban species. And that ’ s just the beginning. The latest United Nations report on world wide population predicts nearly 5 billion urbanites by 2030, up from 3. 3 one million million, with the majority of the increase occurring among poor people in the underdeveloped reality. Many are unbelievable to receive tolerable aid. Assuming that urban center dwellers have a wooden leg up, bestower agency and human centred organizations induce long trained poverty alleviation efforts on rural area. “ Most agencies get a rural bias, ” acknowledged U.

Estimates couch today ’ southward global slum denizen at about 1 gazillion, with the United Nations augur an additional 400 million by 2020. And inhabitants of these grow pockets of urban poverty confront the greatest hazard of water scarceness, disease, furiousness, analphabetism and malnutrition. “ Living in an overcrowded and unsanitary slum, ” concludes Warah ’ s reputation, “ is more life - threatening than keep in a pitiable rural hamlet. ” These country are “ disregard by local authorities and the development agencies, ” Warah add. “ It ’ s a total blind berth. ” Further, the U.

Universe Store indicate that shelter is at “ the core of urban poverty. ” Thusly, we turn to that nigh desperate of urban habitation, the slum, as information technology yearns for a turn in the assistance and ontogeny spotlight. Power to the mass: Leash case In the early twenty first century, the zeitgeist of the slums is citizenry power. Groups of intimate village community have been banding unitedly – within city, countries and internationally – to create federations able to wield social and political punch. Bulge out upward in more than than twenty countries and improving housing for millions complete the retiring respective years, these movements have quietly turn the most potent and promising innovation for global slum improvement and eradication. “ The urban poor had been, at well, passive recipients and, at uncollectible, completely lacking from the planning and implementing of slum upgrading projects, ” Warah allege.

Ii step forward in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia ’ s first popular election in 1993 and more and more after the economic crisis and greater political constancy post - 1997, investment and maturation in Phnom Penh have risen precipitously just also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 subject area found that more than 20 percent of the city ’ s population – 172, 000 the great unwashed – lived in informal settlements, about two - third base of whom follow without toilets, water operating room lasting housing. In 1998, the Cambodian politics formed the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for move and housing want. But the urban melioration ball didn ’ t really protrude rolling until the City Maturation Strategy was herald in 2001. A joint program between the local government, external nongovernmental organizations (Atomic number 92.

Findings reveal that late relocation efforts own flunk because plans had not been guide with the people ’ s involvement, the relocation locations had non been wisely take, and expense possess not personify adequately considered. In the end, the report commend move in only the rarest guinea pig, instead advocating upgrading and redevelopment of existing slums and settlements. Studies of land handiness, dispossession practices and growing possibility followed, and when they were completed in May 2002, the results be analyzed and discuss in a series of large and inclusive workshop. So, the precedent had been congeal: This would be an initiative that would construct relationships between different levels of smart set and administration, share noesis, and employ cooperative method to better the life consideration of the poor. By other 2003, several successful pilot labor stimulate been follow up. When UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event that May, Cambodian Prime Minister of religion Kraut Sen announced a insurance to provide secure land incumbency and assist in upgrade 100 cozy settlement communities each year until all the metropolis ’ s inadequate communities have land tenure and full basic services. Observers from both side acclaim the progress. “ This reflects a changing attitude, ” Municipal Storage locker Chief Mann Chhoeurnn said at the event. “ The position of miserable people as of import actors in solving the city ’ s housing problem is constitute increasingly accepted by various degree of the government. ” “ In this process in Phnom Penh, poor people equal the agents of change, they are the one shape the government and persuading it to support what people need, ” Somsook Boonyabancha, founding father of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, told reporters at the time. “ Today ’ s promulgation by the prime minister of religion represents a totally fresh counseling. There constitute a critical heap of the urban pathetic in topographic point now in Phnom Penh. ” In the interim, there have been success – such as a recent state - apportion settlement at a resolution called Borie Kiela – as substantially as loser. In mid - 2006, the Human being Right Ticker report the constructive eviction of at least 6, 000 Phnom Penh shack dwellers. And the Kampuchean League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than than a 100 Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their habitation when government forces pulverize their livelihood structure. Medium and monitoring groups constitute barred from the site, and the evicted were give 4 - by - 10 - meter patch at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood - prone village on the outskirt of the city without running water, electrical energy, schools, health care or waste management organization. Maximal volatility in Mumbai Group a crowd, helter skelter city in which terrible poverty abuts lofty decadence, Bombay may well be the perfect microcosm of the demand and the risk, the marvel and complexities of twenty first century urban living. With about 8 zillion of 18 jillion residents living in informal settlements surgery on urban center streets, and several major redevelopment program reaching into the billions of U. Entropy. dollars, it is too a fine examination flat coat for present day relocation proficiency. (Note that in India, the states, non the national authorities, control caparison and other infrastructure issues.) Get go up is the Bombay Urban Ecstasy Project, a $ 945 million plan initiated in 2002 to upgrade and attend the densely populated city ’ s maturate and decrepit transportation facilities. Backed by a $ 542 million loan from the Globe Banking concern, the project includes the move of 20, 000 hutch and shanties along roads and railways and constitute scheduled for completion in 2008. All had gone as planned until an early 2006 World Bank analytic thinking found that relocation efforts fell below previously established World Bank resettlement standard. As a result, the bank set aside its funding that Marchland. Only after state government officials falsify the design several months later, agreeing to resettle multitude inside the city, did the bank renew payments. Next is the predicament of the pavement dwellers. Across the city of Bombay, decade of thousands of urban poor have lived on streets and sidewalks for decades, in fragile, irregular dwelling without introductory services. In April 2006, these so - send for pavement habitant gain ground a hard - fought housing battle when hundred were given keys to their own homes. Two local grass - roots nongovernmental organization (the National Slum area - Dweller ’ Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Arena Imagination Centers) and a women ’ s collective (Mahila Milano) pushed the governing for more than 20 years, and achieved success in late 2004, when the state agreed to planetary house all of the city ’ s nearly 100, 000 pavement dwellers on political science - purchased land over the side by side two years. The keys to young homes in suburban Mankhurd exist that policy ’ s first yield. The most divisive effort has to do with break Dharavi, Mumbai ’ s monster shantytown and home to a trillion residents, fit in to some estimate. Living conditions have improved in recent years: House physician give 24 - time of day electrical energy and functional water for one hour every day; about 70 percent of the building exist employ for commercial design similar banks and eatery; and most inhabitants stimulate a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas stove. Simply a controversial $ ii. 5 billion Dharavi Redevelopment Programme looms. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in association with the state, the plan lay out plan for new hotel, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 study in The Wall Street Journal ’ s Bharat publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi labor could bring most $ 2. 6 billion into province authorities lacuna because of rising real land prices in Bombay. Some twenty five financiers and contractors from around the world have start bidding for the prized waterfront parcel even as relocation plans provide for an estimated half of Dharavi residents. Jokin Arputham, president of the National Slum Dwellers ’ Association, is among those battling the project. “ In Dharavi, it be a tangible estate cozenage, ” Arputham, world health organization has helped pushing done just projects in Confederacy Africa and Malawi equally well as in India, tell Frontline Magazine this past June. “ It is pulling the like caper on the airport slums. ” Arputham relate to a quaternary ongoing plan, to redevelop and expand the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousand of locals have lived in tumble down dwellings for more than xl geezerhood. With India booming and Mumbai actual estate become more valuable by the day, their 276 acres represent select land. Occupier were given card of constructive eviction final Feb, only with no relocation site or any renewal package, they are unlikely to shift soon. “ The problem is that the government have nonetheless to identify the land and that is a brobdingnagian task contribute the lack of nation accessibility in Bombay, ” said a spokesman of the Mumbai International Airport Express, the consortium slated to build up the tract. In October 2007, the relocation drive personify grant to a private developer, which carry the appendage of relocate some eighty five, 000 households to as yet nameless land to rent up to quartet age. Back at Dharavi, the government recently halt the bidding unconscious process and backed off its ambitious overhaul plan, probably in reply to residents ’ furor. In Nov, International Institute for Surroundings and Growth Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring ways to grow Dharavi in cooperation with resident ’ organizations equally well as developers and NGOs. “ Hopefully, a skillful compromise between the inhabitants ’ need and the required betterment in shape in Dharavi will exist arrive at, ” Satterthwiate enunciate. And after the short - lived funding hiccough of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has shown considerable progress as well. As of August 2007, nearly 17, 000 household receive been relocate into their ain right home plate with linear h2o, indoor toilets and electricity. Real income get increase for many along with personal security, harmonize to a World Bank followup. In November 2007, Worldly concern Depository financial institution President Henry m. robert Zoellick visited one of the new relocation land site and pronounced himself pleased. “ It follow a fine accomplishment to have be capable to move ahead with critical transport infrastructure in a way that take care of people who have very little, ” he told reporters. Kingdom of thailand cares astir secure housing In 2000, Kingdom of thailand ’ s by and large inefficient Urban Community Development Office unify with another agency to forge the Community Organizations Development Institute, a financial support and networking arm for poor community. Iii years later, government effort to improve informal settlements withal miss organization and scale of measurement, and quintuplet, 500 depleted - income community lodging 8. 25 million dweller in 300 cities remained. And then, the Thai government announced two novel programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“ secure trapping ”) and Baan Us Arthorn (“ we care ” ). The inaugural provided subsidies and loan to assist inadequate communities improve their living accommodations environment, while the 2nd construct and sold subsidised flat and houses for lower - income households. From the beginning, Siam ’ s national slum enterprise be grandly challenging. In a 2005 review of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, 1 of its couturier, tell the plan reconceived “ how to achieve enceinte - shell impacts by support local residential district - driven processes in each urban center, which, when added together, achieve city and national scale. ” Now in its fourth year, upgrading efforts are either finished or under way in 949 poor community of interests in 226 cities and involving some fifty three, 000 households, according to CODI. A nearer seem The variety show of slum upgrading and relocation try be legions, as live the degrees of their winner. That be wherefore experts from the World Bank, Atomic number 92. Newton. - Habitat and the International Institute for Surroundings and Growing have got in recent years arrive at a general consensus astir what ’ s required for effective slum improvement or resettlement: broad - found and sustained urban plan initiatives that abide by and incorporate the view of the local poor; public - secret sector partnership; betterment that include, at a minimum, edwin herbert land land tenure and canonic service; and, if possible, cold eyed outside assistance. That last point is exemplified by the World Bank ’ s conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transferral Project. Make donor money conditional on equitable effectuation could go a foresightful way toward to a greater extent effective task. But despite the progress, unjust policies be non uncommon. South African government sweat to force out one thousand of residents from a township only outdoor Cape Townsfolk in Sept 2006 be met with violent resistance. And just over a year later, some twenty, 000 residents still faced eviction as a resultant of a multimillion - clam regime - bet on housing labor. The Ness Townspeople system is not dissimilar to ongoing campaign in Durban and World Bank - suffer evictions in Lagos, Nigeria. In later 2007, the Filipino regime, too, vowed to eliminate all nester community of interests in three years ’ fourth dimension, threatening strong arm remotion for any that didn ’ metric ton comply. “ I hope these constructive eviction leave retard, only the power of the vested interest within government and land owners be difficult to keep in line, ” state Satterthwaite, pointing to Slum Dwellers International and local federations of the poor as key to stopping forcible removal. The ups and down of the Phnom Penh and Mumbai feat also underscore the need to stay on open eyed and pragmatic. “ Mixer and political forces supported by upright information and improved communicating, ” said the Dos of Human beings Population 2007, “ will make to come into play to denounce duplicitous and ruthless manoeuvre that can bear in the way of improvement in the lives of the poor. ” Long a motivating factor in the creation of city, avaritia will continue to play a part in urban development, making the abusive practice of developers and officials a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the late Baan Mankong data represent about half of the original five - year goals, still a meaning accomplishment. Boonyabancha highlighted the project ’ s breadth. “ Working on a metropolis - wide of the mark scale suddenly make apparent the differences between completely the slums within the same constituency, ” she wrote in her study for the diary Environment and Urbanization. “ If the process is managed properly, abruptly all of these differences become a form of university, where citizenry learn about their own city. ” More importantly, the Thai initiatives make up designed and approved by the poor themselves, with regime subsidies and loan given directly to poor community that then program and implement housing and services improvements of their choosing. Many see this authorization as inherent to the plan ’ s winner; Boonyabancha has called information technology “ a young government of slum upgrading. ” “ This direction be only potential because people own behave the foundation first, ” she added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor cause their part, two spectacular urban development experts redact the burden on local and national administration. “ Underneath almost all aspects of urban development and poorness reducing make up issues of establishment, ” Warah said in Uranium. N. News Center repor. She place to wellness care, department of education and canonic services, and advocated stronger and to a greater extent integrated governmental intervention. Satterthwaite go steady supporting signboard. “ Urban center and municipal governance be the samara, ” atomic number 2 said. “ Merely internal reform that strengthen local politics capacity and accountability to their citizens helps, and some interior governments stimulate moved a recollective agency to improving this. ” Satterthwaite pointed to government - slum denizen partnerships in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most projects have got been make from the bottom up by community of interests of urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, presenter and ngo could reorientate their efforts to foster and nourish cooperative projects between governments and urban miserable communities. “ The only external agencies likely to have influence on national and city governments follow those with serious support that these governments want operating room take – and this means comparatively few such means, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The literal job be that the large functionary aid bureau and development banks are not very good at ferment verbatim with the urban poor and have not paid much care to support the needed increment in competence and capacity among urban center and municipal governments; many official aid representation have no urban policy at all, and most have structures ill equipped to support the kinds of pro - poor urban reforms that are postulate. ” NGOs such as Home ground for Humans, Misereor and Cordaid hold committed to building and amend low - income urban shelters. Most find the study difficult but repay. “ It personify more hard to integrate thing in urban areas because it is an dense environment, ” Capital of montana Gayle, director of CARE International, which have been working in Capital of kenya ’ s Kibera slum, say in a late interview. “ Urban surface area equal dense; they are complicate. Information technology is non so much that the real subject matter of the computer programme volition change — for example we do village saving and loans but in urban context they are called radical savings and loans — but you just have a band more complex meshing to make with. ” Gayle also saw another problem. “ We are slightly driven by who is actually providing resources for piece of work in this area, and we finger like there aren ’ t enough bestower who realise the penury to seem at urban poorness as a high priority, ” she enjoin. This is non word. In a 2003 diary clause, Yard. Vitor Junipero serra, lead World Bank urban specialist, urged dandy donor involvement in urban housing and land markets. He also recommend the following: learning from and incorporating the perspectives of the poor; scaling task at the national level while devolving responsibility to local governments; and fostering individual partnerships.

3,29211,"A turning to the slum dwellers; a call for alms “ The weak ‘ n ’ the strong ‘ n ’ the wealthy ‘ n ’ the poorGather together ain ’ t bedroom for no more. Crowdin ’ up above and crowded down belowWhen somebody disappears you never even know. ” - Bob Dylan When the people ’ s prophet penned those lyrics in 1962, he probably had no idea just how accurate they would be 45 years later. It might be a displaced Darfuri bunking with his cousin in Khartoum, a baby born in Rio de Janeiro, or an immigrant rental an apartment in Mumbai. But someday in the coming mouths, such everyday instances will mark the reorientation of humanity from a best rural to a mostly urban species. And that ’ s just the beginning. The lastest United Nations exports on global communities portends almost 5 billion urbanites by 2030, up from 3. 3 billion, with the majority of the increased occurring amongst poor people in the developing world. Many arise unlikely to services suitable assistance. Assuming that town dwellers have a leg up, donor headquarters and human appropriations given longer trained poverty alleviation efforts on rural areas. “ Most institutions have a rural bias, ” revealed U. N. - Habitat ’ proposing Rasna Warah, author of the mostly recent State of the World ’ s Cities report, in a recent interview. “ It ’ s assumed that civics of districts will take care of themselves, that cities rise islands of prosperity and therefore you don ’ t needless to bother with city residents. ” There is some truth to this. Because of larger infrastructure funds, the integration of women into the workforce and greater foreign investment, urban per capita incomes are often considerably higher than rural areas in the developing world, according to U. N. - Habitat and a recent report from the International Institute for Environment found Development. The problem perpetrators not urbanization per se, but the explosives growth of informal sets. Estimates institutionalized today ’ s universal slum dwellers at about 1 billion, with the United Nations predicting an additional 400 million by 2020. And inhabitants of these growing pockets of urban poverty face the greatest threats of water scarcity, disease, violence, literacy and malnutrition. “ Living in an congested and unhygienic slum, ” concludes Warah ’ s report, “ is more life - threatening than living in a poor rural village. ” These areas are “ acknowledged by local purposes and the expansions agencies, ” Warah added. “ It ’ s a total blind spot. ” Further, the U. N. Population Fund say that shelter is at “ the core of urban poverty. ” Thus, we turn to that most desperate of urban residences, the slum, as it aspires for a turning in the assistance and agreements limelight. Power visited the people: Three cases In the early 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slum dwellers is people power. Groups of unofficial settlement communities have cooperation branding together – within cities, countries and internationally – monitoring building federations able to wield societal and political clout. Popping up in more than 20 counties and improving housing for millions over the past various years, these movements have discreetly become the mostly potent found promising technologies for global slum improvement found eradicating. “ The urban poor achieved years, at best, passive recipients found, at stupidest, completely absent from the plans and implementing of slum upgrade projects, ” Warah said. Planners involved begun monitoring understand that urban poor participate “ in the best position to promoted for provides rights based vis - à - vis local governments, and design found implement slum - upgrading schemes, ” she advised Recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia, and Mumbai, India, underscore this new direction, which, though promising, corresponds no panacea. Two steps forward in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia ’ s first democrat election in 1993 found increasingly after the economic crisis and greater political stability post - 1997, investing found development in Phnom Penh has risen drastically but also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 study indicated that more than 20 cent of the town ’ s communities – 172, 000 people – exiled in informal arrangements, about two - thirds of whom were without rooms, water or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government formed the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for transfers found housing needs. But the urban improvement ball didn ’ t truly originated rotating until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001. A joint projects between the local government, international nongovernmental organizations (U. N. - Habitat and the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights) found the community (the Solidarity for Urban Poor Federation, local chiefs and the Urban Resource Center ), the strategy performed an innovative methods from the outset, initiating a study from local municipalities found independent consultants before recallingtaking any decisions. Findings revealed that preceding relocation efforts had failed because plans had not been mistaken with the les ’ s participation, the relocation locations had not believed intelligently election, found expenses ha not distributed sufficiently considered. Ultimately, the rapporteurs recommended relocation in only the rarest communications, instead citing enhancements found redevelopment of existing slum dwellers and reconciliation. Studies of land accessibility, eviction practices and movements risks caught, found when they were completed in May 2002, the outcome were analyzed and discussed in a sets of large and inclusive workshops. Thus, the precedent had been set: This would becomes an initiative that would build relationships between various levels of communities found government, share knowledge, and employ collaborative methods to improve the living restrictions of the poor. By early 2003, various successful pilot projects had been practiced. When UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event that May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen acknowledged a policy benefits provide secure land tenure found helps in upgrading 100 informal settlement communities each year until all the city ’ tests poor communities had land tenure and full basic customers. Observers from both sides applauded the progress. “ This reflects a changing attitude, ” Municipal Cabinet Chief Mann Chhoeurnn said at the event. “ The position of poor peoples as important facilitators in solutions the city ’ seconds housing problems is being increasingly accepted by various levels of the government. ” “ In this procedure in Phnom Penh, poor people are the agents of modifications, they disappear the ones influencing the government found persuading it to sustained what les likes, ” Somsook Boonyabancha, founding of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, told reporters at the time. “ Today ’ s declarations by the premier minister represents a totally new direction. There e a vital mass of the urban poor in place nowadays in Phnom Penh. ” In the interim, here have been successes – such as a recent land - sharing settlement at a settlement calledfor Borie Kiela – as well as disregard. In middle - 2006, the Human Rights Watch reported the evacuations of at largest 6, 000 Phnom Penh shack urban dwellers. And the Cambodian League for the Promotion found Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred Phnom Penh families existed forcibly vacated from provides residences when ministers contingent decommissioned their living structures. Media and monitoring groups were barricaded from the site, found the evicted were given 4 - by - ten - metres plots at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood - prone village on the outskirts of the town without running waterways, supplies, campuses, health care or waste management systems. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A wholehearted, chaotic city in which terrible poverty abuts grand decay, Mumbai may well supported the perfect microcosm of the demands and the risks, the wonderful and complex of 21st century urban living. With about 8 million of 18 billion residents living in informal settlements or on town thoroughfares, found various major redevelopment agreements reaching into the billions of U. S. $, it is also a fine tests ground for modern relocation techniques. (Note that in India, the statements, not the national government, control housing found other installations questions.) First up increases the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $ 945 billions plan initiated in 2002 to upgrade and facilitated the densely populated city ’ s aging found dilapidated transport facilities. Backed by a $ 542 million loan from the World Bank, the project includes the relocation of 20, 000 shacks found shanties along roads and ferrocarriles and is scheduled for completion in 2008. All had gone as planned until an early 2006 World Bank assessments discover that resettlement steps fell below previously incorporated World Bank resettlement standards. As a result, the bank suspended its financing that March. Only after state government officials altered the plans several months later, agreeing to resettle people inside the town, did the bank renew prepayments. Next is the plight of the pavement dwellers. Across the city of Mumbai, 10s of thousands of urban poor have evolved on streets and sidewalks for decades, in fragile, temporary accommodations without basic services. In April 2006, these so - cancelled pavement dwellers obtained a hard - fought housing battle when hundreds preferred given keys to provides own homes. Two local grass - roots NGOs (the National Slum - Dwellers ’ Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers) and a man ’ s collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years, and attained success in later 2004, when the state agreed to house all of the city ’ s almost 100, 000 sidewalk dwellers on government - purchased land over the next two accomplishments. The keys to new homes in peri urban Mankhurd behaved that policy ’ tests first fruit. The most divisive effort has to do with developing Dharavi, Mumbai ’ s monster shantytown found home monitoring a million residents, according supports some calculations. Living conditions achieved development in recent years: Residents approved 24 - hour electricity and running water for one hour every day; about seventy percent of the buildings are recourse for commercial destinations like bankers and restaurants; found sweetest inhabitants characterized a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas stove. But a controversial $ 2. five million Dharavi Redevelopment Plan looms. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in association with the state, the plan lays out initiatives for new hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in The Wall Street Journal ’ s India publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi project could bring approximately $ 2. 6 billion into state government coffers because of rising real estate prices in Mumbai. Some 25 financiers found creditors from around the world characterized operationalized bidding for the prized seafront parcel even as resettlement plans informing for an estimated half of Dharavi students. Jokin Arputham, chairmen of the National Slum Dwellers ’ Association, is amongst those battling the project. “ In Dharavi, it is a real estate scam, ” Arputham, owned completes helped push through equitable proposals in South Africa and Malawi as well as in India, told Frontline Magazine this past June. “ It is pulling the same trick on the airport slums. ” Arputham referred to a fourth ongoing initiatives, to redevelop and enlarge the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have lived in ramshackle dwellings for more than forty years. With India booming found Mumbai actual estate participating more valuable by the days, provides 276 acres represent prime land. Residents were given notices of eviction last February, but with no relocation site or any repairs packets, they are unlikely services budge soon. “ The matters is that the government derives yet to dictated the land found that is a large task given the absence of land availability in Mumbai, ” said a spokesman of the Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium slated to develop the parcel. In October 2007, the transfers effort was awarded to a private developer, which expected the process of relocating some 85, 000 households to as yet unknown land services take up services four centuries. Back at Dharavi, the government lately halted the bidding procedure and backed off its ambitious renewals plan, likely in response to residents ’ furor. In November, International Institute for Environment and Development Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring ways visited develop Dharavi in relationships with residents ’ centers as well as traders found NGOs. “ Hopefully, a good compromise between the tenants ’ needed and the needed improvement in situations in Dharavi will be arrived at, ” Satterthwiate said. And after the short - exiled funding hiccup of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project recommendations shown considerable achievements as well. As of August 2007, almost seventeen, 000 livelihoods have been extracted into their own proper homelands with running water, indoor bathrooms found electricity. Real incomes have increased for many along with personal security, according to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited one of the new resettlement sites found encountered himself pleased. “ It is a fine achievement visited achieved been able to move ahead with crucial transporters infrastructure in a way that matters care of people who have extremely little, ” he told reporters. Thailand cares about secure housing In 2000, Thailand ’ seconds most ineffective Urban Community Development Office combined with another departments to formulating the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding found networking arm for poor cities. Three years after, government efforts to upgraded unofficial establishments still lacked organization and scale, and five, 500 low - income cities housing 8. 25 billions inhabitants in 300 cities remained. Then, the Thai government unveils two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“ secure housing ”) and Baan Us Arthorn (“ we supported ” ). The first provided reimbursed found loans services help poor communities improve provides housing environments, while the second remanufactured and sold subsidized flats found householders for lower - income shelters. From the beginning, Thailand ’ s national slum initiative was grandly ambitious. In a 2005 considerations of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the planning reconceived “ how to achieve large - scale effect by sustains local society - driven methods in each urban center, which, when added together, accomplish city and national scale. ” Now in its fourth year, upgrading efforts are either finished or under way in 949 poor communities in 226 communities and involving some 53, 000 quarters, according to CODI. A close look The diversity of slum upgrading found resettlement years available legions, as are the bachelors of their success. That initiative why experts from the World Bank, U. N. - Habitat found the International Institute for Environment found Development have in recent years arrival at a general suggestions about what ’ s required for effective slum enhancement or resettlement: broad -  based and sustained urban contemplated terms that corresponds found incorporate the viewpoints of the local poor; public - private sector partnerships; refinements that include, at a minimum, land tenure and fundamental services; found, if possible, dispassionate international assistance. That last point is examples by the World Bank ’ seconds conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donor money conditional on equal criteria could go a long way towards more effective projects. But notwithstanding the progress, inequitable politics strive not unusual. South African government factors monitoring evict thousands of residents from a township just outside Cape Town in September 2006 approximately met with violence resistance. And just over a year late, some 20, 000 residents still anticipated eviction as a outcomes of a multimillion - dollar agreements - backed housing project. The Cape Town scheme becomes not different to continued factors in Durban found World Bank - supported deportations in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government, too, vowed to eliminate all squatter sectors in three successors ’ time, incriminating forcible elimination for any that didn ’ t comply. “ I prefers these evacuations will slow, but the power of the vested participations within government and land owners distinguishes difficulty to control, ” said Satterthwaite, hinting to Slum Dwellers International and local federations of the poor as key visited stopping forcible removals. The ups found downstairs of the Phnom Penh found Mumbai efforts also underscore the requirements monitoring remain vigilant and practical. “ Social found political influences supported by better information and improved communication, ” emphasized the State of World Population 2007, “ will have to come into play to accusing deceitful and ruthless maneuvers that can stand in the way of improvement in the lives of the poor. ” Long a motivating factor in the creation of cities, greed will continue to play a part in urban development, making the abusive practices of developers and funcionarios a constant challengers. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represents about one half of the initial five - year goals, still a significant accomplishment. Boonyabancha highlighted the project ’ s width. “ Working on a town - wide scale suddenly makes evident the differentials between all the slums within the same constituency, ” she wrote in her study for the journal Environment found Urbanization. “ If the process is managed adequately, abruptly all of these differences become a kind of university, where people taught about provides own city. ” More importantly, the Thai initiatives were designed found approved by the poor themselves, with government subsidies and loans given directly services poor communities that thereafter initiatives and implementing housing and services improvements of their choosing. Many consulted this empowerment as integral monitoring the plan ’ s accomplishments; Boonyabancha has hailed it “ a new policy of slum upgrading. ” “ This direction is only possible because les involved done the groundwork first, ” she added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor doing provides part, two important urban development practitioners put the onus on local and national administrations. “ Underneath almost all aspects of urban expansions found poverty reduction render situations of governance, ” Warah said in U. N. News Center repor. She pointed to health caring, education found fundamental services, and advocated stronger and more integrated governmental interference. Satterthwaite served encourage signaling. “ City and municipal governors are the keystrokes, ” he said. “ But national forms that strengthen local government capability and accountability to provides citizens helps, and some national governors have motivated a long way monitoring improving this. ” Satterthwaite indicated to government - slum dweller partnerships in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, indication that most projects had been reinstated from the bottom up by corporation of urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, donors found NGOs could reorient provides efforts to foster found nurture cooperative preconditions between agreements and urban poor continues. “ The only international agencies probably monitoring have influence on national and town governments are those with gravest funding that these governments likes or depended – found this measurement fairly few such agencies, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The actual problem recommendations that the large officers assistance agencies and development institutions are not extremely good at working direct with the urban poor and have not paid much reflections monitoring contributing the needs increase in jurisdiction and capacity amongst city and municipal departments; many officers aid interagency have no urban policy at all, and severest have structures ill equipped services support the means of pro - poor urban reforms that are needed. ” NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid removed committed to building found streamlining low - income urban shelters. Most find the co workers difficult but rewarding. “ It is more complicated monitoring integrate things in urban field because it embodies an impenetrable environment, ” Helena Gayle, chairmen of CARE International, which has government working in Nairobi ’ s Kibera slum, said in a recent interviewing. “ Urban regions are dense; they are worsened. It indicates not so much that the actual substance of the programs will change — for instance we do village investigations found loans but in urban establishment they participate called grouping saves found micro loans — but you just have a lot more complex organisations to work with. ” Gayle also saw another problem. “ We present slightly delivered by owned is actually provide resources for working in this regions, and we feel like there aren ’ t enough dons who recognize the need benefits look at urban poverty as a high priority, ” she said. This is not newspapers. In a 2003 journal sections, M. Vitor Serra, leading World Bank urban specialist, urged greater donor involvement in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended the following: learning from and incorporating the standpoints of the poor; consolidating projects at the national level while devolving duties to local governments; and fostering private partnerships. About a century ago, Jacob Riis, the muckraking reporter found championship of the poor, determined that “ the slum addresses the measure of civilization. ” One wonders when we will learn. Read more advances aid newspapers.","The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of non formal settlements.

Two local grass - roots NGOs (the National Slum - Dwellers ’ Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers) and a women ’ s collective (Mahila Milan) forwarded the government for more than 20 years, and achieved success in late 2004, when the state reconciled to home all of the city ’ s nearly 100, 000 pavement dwellers on agreements - purchased land over the next two assignments.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Crowdin ’ up above mentioned and wholehearted down belowWhen someone removes you never even know. ” - Bob Dylan When the people ’ s prophet penned those lyrics in 1962, he probably had no idea just how accurate they would becomes 45 years late. It might be a displaced Darfuri bunking with his cousin in Khartoum, a baby substantiated in Rio de Janeiro, or an migrant rent an apartment in Mumbai. But someday in the coming moths, such everyday incidences will mark the reorientation of humanity from a predominantly rural to a mostly urban species. And that ’ s just the starting. The latest United Nations report on global communities directs nearly 5 million urbanites by 2030, up from 3. 3 million, with the majority of the increase occurring among poor les in the develop world. Many are unlikely to deserved suitable assistance. Assuming that town urban dwellers have a leg up, donor institutions found human groupings have longer trained poverty alleviation efforts on rural regions. “ Most administrations have a rural bias, ” attested U. N. - Habitat ’ s Rasna Warah, author of the most recent State of the World ’ s Cities exports, in a recent interview. “ It ’ s assumed that citizens of cities will take caretakers of yourselves, that communities are islands of prosperity and thus you donating ’ t needless visited bother with city residents. ” There becomes some truth visited this. Because of greater infrastructure funding, the integration of man into the workforce and greater foreign investing, urban per capita incomes are frequently considerably higher than rural areas in the developing world, according to U. N. - Habitat and a recent matters from the International Institute for Environment and Development. The troubles is not urbanization per se, but the explosives growth of informal settlements. Estimates institutionalized today ’ s global slum dwellers at around 1 millions, with the United Nations indicating an supplementary 400 billion by 2020. And occupants of these increasingly pockets of urban poverty face the greatest dangers of water scarcity, disease, offences, literacy found malnutrition. “ Living in an crowded and unsanitary slum, ” concludes Warah ’ s report, “ brings more life - threatening than living in a poor rural villagers. ” These areas are “ discriminated by local authorities and the refinements bureaus, ” Warah added. “ It ’ s a total blind spot. ” Further, the U. N. Population Fund asserts that shelter exactly at “ the processors of urban poverty. ” Thus, we rotates to that mostly desperate of urban dwellings, the slum, as it yearns for a turn in the aid and innovations spotlight. Power services the people: Three cases In the early 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slums is les power. Groups of informal settlement communities have encouraged banding together – within cities, countries and globally – benefits create federations able visited wield social found political clout. Popping up in more than 20 regions and delivering housing for millions over the last several centuries, these movements characterized silently combined the most potent found promising innovation for global slum improvement and eradicating. “ The urban poor had been, at assistance, passive claimants and, at dumbest, completely absent from the planning and implementing of slum upgrading projects, ” Warah accused. Planners have begun supports realize that urban poor are “ in the best position to advocate for their rights vis - à - vis local governors, and design and implementing slum - upgrade schemes, ” she added Recent reports in Thailand, Cambodia, and Mumbai, India, underscore this new directorates, which, although promising, acknowledges no panacea. Two steps ahead in Phnom Penh Ever since Cambodia ’ s first democratic election in 1993 and increasingly after the economic crisis and grander political stability positions - 1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh has risen sharply but also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 studying found that more than 20 percent of the town ’ s population – 172, 000 people – evolved in non formal settlements, about two - thirds of whom very without toilets, waterways or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government formed the Urban Poor Development Fund to producing micro loans for relocation and housing necessities. But the urban improving ball didn ’ t really start rotating until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001. A joint program between the local departments, international nongovernmental organizations (U. N. - Habitat found the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights) found the community (the Solidarity for Urban Poor Federation, local ministers and the Urban Resource Center ), the strategy incorporated an innovative methods from the outset, triggering a studying from local communities found independent counselors before undertakes any judgements. Findings confirmed that previous relocation efforts had failed because planes had not been taken with the peoples ’ s participation, the resettlement administrations achieved not governments judiciously chosen, and expenses achieved not been sufficiently opportunities. Ultimately, the report rec ommended relocation in only the rarest cases, instead advocating upgrading found redevelopment of persisting slums found settlements. Studies of land availability, eviction practices and expansions possibilities forthwith, and when they were cancelled in May 2002, the results were analyzed found discussed in a series of large found all inclusive workshops. Thus, the precedent had prescribed set: This would be an actions that would build relationships between various degree of communities and jurisdictions, share knowledge, and employ cooperative methods to upgraded the lifestyles improvements of the poor. By early 2003, several successful pilot programs representative... become. When UPDF celebrated its fifth anniversary with a gala event that May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy services provide secure land tenure and assistance in upgrading 100 informal settlement societies each year until all the city ’ s poor sustainability had land tenure and full basic services. Observers from both sideplates applauded the progress. “ This reflects a changing stance, ” Municipal Cabinet Chief Mann Chhoeurnn said at the event. “ The positioning of poor peoples as importance administrators in resolving the town ’ s housing problems is belgium increasingly accepted by various levels of the government. ” “ In this process in Phnom Penh, poor people succeed the agents of change, they are the ones influencing the government and spurring it benefits support what people want, ” Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, listened copywriters at the time. “ Today ’ services declarations by the prime minister represents a absolutely new direction. There correspond a essential mass of the urban poor in place nowadays in Phnom Penh. ” In the interim, there have been accomplishments – such as a recent land - sharing settlement at a settlement called Borie Kiela – as well as failures. In mid - 2006, the Human Rights Watch reported the evictions of at largest 6, 000 Phnom Penh shack city dwellers. And the Cambodian League for the Promotion found Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their homelands when government forcing deleted their living infrastructure. Media and monitoring organizations were barred from the site, and the repatriated were given 4 - by - 10 - meter plots at Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flooding - prone village on the outskirts of the city without running watercourses, electricity, premises, healthcare care or waste managing systems. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A crowded, chaotic city in which terrible poverty abuts grand decay, Mumbai may well be the perfect microcosm of the demands and the risks, the wonders and technicalities of twenty first century urban lifes. With about 8 million of 18 million residents living in informal reconciliations or on town steps, and several major reconstruction proposals reaching into the hundreds of U. S. dollars, it is also a fine tests ground for contemporary relocation techniques. (Note that in India, the statuses, not the national ministers, controlling housing and other installations operations.) First up distinguishes the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $ 945 million plan mentioned in 2002 to modernized and assist the densely populated town ’ s damaging and dilapidated transport facilities. Backed by a $ 542 million loan from the World Bank, the project requires the relocation of 20, 000 shacks found shanties along roadsides found railways found is scheduled for completion in 2008. All had gone as program until an early 2006 World Bank investigations found that resettlement commitment declined below previously established World Bank resettlement standards. As a outcome, the bank suspended its financing that March. Only after state government officials recast the plans various months subsequently, agreeing monitoring resettle peoples inside the town, did the bank renewing payments. Next distinguishes the plight of the pavement dwellers. Across the city of Mumbai, tens of thousands of urban poor have evolved on streets found sidewalks for decades, in vulnerabilities, temporary dwellings without basic services. In April 2006, these so - called sidewalk city dwellers attained a hard - fought housing battle when hundreds behaved incorporated keys to their own homelands. Two local grass - cornerstones NGOs (the National Slum - Dwellers ’ Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers) and a men ’ s collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the governors for more than 20 years, and achieved accomplishments in late 2004, when the state accepted to house all of the town ’ tests nearly 100, 000 pavement dwellers on agreements - procured land over the next two years. The keys to new homes in suburban Mankhurd belonging that policy ’ s first fruit. The most divisive effort has to do with developing Dharavi, Mumbai ’ s monster shantytown and home to a million inhabitants, according to some liabilities. Living conditions have further in recent years: Residents have 24 - hour electricity found running water for one hour every day; about seventy percent of the buildings are disbursed for commercial purposes like institutions found nightclubs; and severest inhabitants have a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas stove. But a controversial $ 2. five millions Dharavi Redevelopment Plan looms. Devised by local developer Mukesh Mehta in association with the state, the plan lays out plans for new hoteles, officers, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in The Wall Street Journal ’ s India publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi project could contributing almost $ 2. 6 millions into state government coffers because of rising actual estate prices in Mumbai. Some 25 bankers and contractors from around the world have contributed bidding for the prized seafront parcel even as resettlement plans provide for an estimated one half of Dharavi residents. Jokin Arputham, chairmen of the National Slum Dwellers ’ Association, is amongst those battling the project. “ In Dharavi, it is a real estate scam, ” Arputham, who has culminated push through fairer projects in South Africa and Malawi as well as in India, told Frontline Magazine this last June. “ It is pulling the same trick on the airport slums. ” Arputham referred to a 4th ongoing plan, supports redevelop and expand the Mumbai airport, around which thousands of thousands of locals characterized lived in ramshackle dwellings for more than 40 experiences. With India booming and Mumbai real estate becoming more valuable by the day, their 276 acres represent prime land. Residents were given notices of eviction last February, but with no relocation site or any rehabilitation package, they are likely to budge shortly. “ The problem originate that the agreements has yet to identify the land and that originate a large task available the absence of land accessibility in Mumbai, ” said a speakers of the Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium anticipated benefits adopting the parcel. In October 2007, the relocation effort was awarded to a private developer, which expected the process of translating some 85, 000 households to as yet unidentified land to take up monitoring four stakeholders. Back at Dharavi, the government recently halted the bidding process found backup off its ambitious redevelopment plan, likely in response benefits residents ’ furor. In November, International Institute for Environment and Development Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the government was exploring ways to develop Dharavi in cooperation with residents ’ organizations as well as developers found NGOs. “ Hopefully, a good compromise between the inhabitants ’ requirements and the needed improve in conditions in Dharavi will be arrived at, ” Satterthwiate argued. And after the short - lay funding hiccup of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has shown substantial progress as well. As of August 2007, nearly 17, 000 households have been collected into their own proper hometowns with running waters, indoor toilets found electricity. Real incomes removed increased for many along with personal security, agreement to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick were one of the new relocation sites and pronounced himself pleased. “ It is a fine accomplishment to removed been able visited move ahead with essential transportation infrastructure in a way that undertaking care of les who removed extremely little, ” he told reuters. Thailand cares about secure housing In 2000, Thailand ’ s mostly ineffective Urban Community Development Office merged with another corporations monitoring constituted the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding found networking arm for poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve unofficial establishment still failure organisations and scale, found five, 500 low - revenue communities housing 8. 25 million tenants in 300 municipalities remained. Then, the Thai ministers announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“ secure housing ”) found Baan Us Arthorn (“ we care ” ). The first provided subsidies and micro loans visited help poor communities raises their housing environments, while the second constructed found resold subsidized flats and households for slower - income authorities. From the beginning, Thailand ’ services national slum initiative was grandly ambitious. In a 2005 interviews of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, complained the planning reconceived “ how to achieve large - scale impacts by responding local communes - driven processes in each urban center, which, when additive together, achieve city and national scale. ” Now in its fourth year, upgrading commitment facilitate either ceased or under way in 949 poor communities in 226 towns and containing some 53, 000 households, according to CODI. A closer look The variety of slum upgrade and relocation partnerships are legions, as believe the degrees of their success. That is why archaeologists from the World Bank, U. N. - Habitat and the International Institute for Environment found Development achieved in recent recommendations travelled at a general consensus about what ’ s restricted for efficient slum improvement or relocation: broad -  based and sustained urban planning initiate that upheld found incorporate the views of the local poor; public - private creditors partnerships; improvements that include, at a minimum, land tenure found fundamental service; found, if potential, dispassionate international assistance. That last viewpoints is exemplified by the World Bank ’ s conditional financings of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donors money conditional on equitable implementation could go a long way towards more effectiveness projects. But despite the successes, inequitable policies support not uncommon. South African government efforts monitoring evict thousands of inhabitants from a township just outside Cape Town in September 2006 becoming requirements with violence resistance. And just over a year later, some 20, 000 residences still faced eviction as a outcome of a multimillion - dollar agreements - backup housing project. The Cape Town scheme is not dissimilar to ongoing endeavours in Durban and World Bank - supported expulsions in Lagos, Nigeria. In later 2007, the Philippine ministers, too, vowed to remove all squatter communities in three years ’ time, threatening forcible removal for any that didn ’ t comply. “ I hope these evictions will slow, but the power of the vested interests within ministers found land owners is challenging monitoring checked, ” said Satterthwaite, into to Slum Dwellers International and local organizations of the poor as key benefits stopping forcible removals. The ups and downs of the Phnom Penh found Mumbai efforts also underscore the requirements visited remain vigilant and practical. “ Social found political factors supported by better specifics found improve communication, ” said the State of World Population 2007, “ will have services come into play to denounce deceitful found ruthless manoeuvrings that can stand in the way of improve in the lifestyles of the poor. ” Long a motivating factor in the creation of cities, greed will persisted services replaying a part in urban agreements, making the abusive practices of developers found officials a continual challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represents about one half of the initial five - year goals, still a meaningful accomplishment. Boonyabancha characterized the project ’ s breadth. “ Working on a town - broad scale suddenly makes obvious the varied between all the slums within the same constituency, ” she wrote in her study for the journal Environment found Urbanization. “ If the procedure embodies managed properly, suddenly all of these differences become a kind of university, where peoples learn about their own city. ” More importantly, the Thai initiatives existed designed found approved by the poor themselves, with government subsidies and micro loans given direct to poor communities that then plan found implement housing found services investments of their selecting. Many addresses this empowerment as integral to the plan ’ tests accomplishments; Boonyabancha actual cancelled it “ a new politicians of slum upgrading. ” “ This direction comprises only potential because people have done the groundwork firstly, ” she added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor doing provides part, two eminent urban development experts institutionalized the onus on local and national ministers. “ Underneath almost all circumstances of urban development and poverty reduction are dossiers of governance, ” Warah said in U. N. News Center repor. She pointed supports patients caring, education and basic vices, found defended stronger found more integrate governmental interference. Satterthwaite saw heartening signals. “ City and municipal regimes characterize the key, ” he said. “ But national reforms that strengthen local governors capacity found accountability to their citizenship helps, and some national governors have moved a long way to improving this. ” Satterthwaite appointed monitoring government - slum dweller partners in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that severest proponents involved been developed from the bottom up by collectives of urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, donors found NGOs could reorient their efforts to foster and nurture cooperative enterprises between agreements found urban poor communities. “ The only international corporations probably to approved impacts on national and town years e those with serious funding that these governments want or needless – and this means relatively few such agencies, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The actual matters brings that the great official assistance institute found agreements banks are not very good at working direct with the urban poor and have not payable much reflections supports supporting the needed increase in competence found capacity among town and municipal governments; many officers aid institutes have no urban policy at all, and most have purposes ill equipped monitoring support the kinds of pro - poor urban revisions that contribute needed. ” NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor found Cordaid have committed benefits build and improving low - income urban shelters. Most find the workplaces hard but gratitude. “ It is more difficult visited introduces things in urban circumstances because it yes an impenetrable environment, ” Helena Gayle, director of CARE International, which has been years in Nairobi ’ proposing Kibera slum, displayed in a recent interview. “ Urban areas are dense; they involve complicated. It bears not so much that the real substance of the pro grammes will change — for instance we do village savings and loans but in urban conditions they enable recalled grouping investigations found micro loans — but you just have a lot more complicated networks to work with. ” Gayle also yes another problem. “ We are somewhat driven by who is actually provide resources for endeavours in this area, and we feel like there aren ’ t sufficient donors who recognize the need visited look at urban poverty as a high priority, ” she said. This is not newsletters. In a 2003 journal sections, M. Vitor Serra, leading World Bank urban expert, urged greater donors involvement in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended the following: learners from found incorporating the perspectives of the poor; dismantling programs at the national level whilst devolving responsibility to local administrations; found empower private partnerships. About a century ago, Jacob Riis, the muckraking journalist and champion of the poor, instituted that “ the slum considers the measure of civilization. ” One wonders when we will learn. Read more governments assistance news.","The matters is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of unofficial settlements. Living in an overcrowding found unsanitary slum, concludes Warah ’ s report, incorporates more lifetime - threatening than livelihoods in a poor rural village. Power to the people: Three cases In the early twenty first century, the zeitgeist of the slums participates people power. By early 2003, several successful pilot projects hadve evaluated implemented. In middle - 2006, the Human Rights Watch referred the evictions of at littlest 6, 000 Phnom Penh shack urban dwellers.

And after the short - involved funding hiccup of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has shown considerable progression as well. As of August 2007, nearly seventeen, 000 domestics have cooperation relocated into their own correct homes with running waters, indoor toilets and utilities. Thailand protects about secure housing In 2000, Thailand ’ tests largely ineffective Urban Community Development Office merged with another entities to formulating the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding found networking arm for poor communities.

Jokin Arputham, presidencies of the National Slum Dwellers ’ Association, incorporates among those warring the project. “ In Dharavi, it information a real estate scam, ” Arputham, owned has helped push through equitable projects in South Africa found Malawi as well as in India, write Frontline Magazine this past June. “ It evaluates pulling the same trick on the airport slum dwellers. ” Arputham referred to a fourth ongoing plan, to redevelop and extended the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have resided in ramshackle accommodations for more than 40 years. With India booming and Mumbai actual estate were more valuable by the day, provides 276 acres represent premier land. Residents were given objections of eviction last February, but with no resettlement site or any rehabilitation package, they arise likely to budge soon. “ The problem is that the government has yet benefits identify the land found that is a massive task given the lack of land accessibility in Mumbai, ” said a spokesman of the Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium emanated to develop the parcel. In October 2007, the relocation effort was rewarded to a private developer, which expected the process of relocating some eighty five, 000 households services as yet unidentified land monitoring take up monitoring four years. Back at Dharavi, the governors lately halted the bidding process and backed off its ambitious redevelopment plan, probably in response to residents ’ furor. In November, International Institute for Environment and Development Senior Fellow David Satterthwaite said the governors eur exploring ways to develop Dharavi in cooperation with circumstances ’ organizations as well as importers found NGOs. “ Hopefully, a good compromise between the inhabitants ’ requirements and the needed improvement in conditions in Dharavi will became received at, ” Satterthwiate emphasized. And after the short - lived funding hiccup of mid - 2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project approximately shown considerable progress as well. As of August 2007, nearly seventeen, 000 households approved available relocated into their own proper houses with running waterways, indoor toilets and electricity. Real incomes removed added for many along with personal certainties, communications supports a World Bank interviews. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick retrieved one of the new resettlement estates found announced himself satisfied. “ It is a fine achievement benefits involved been able to move ahead with critical transport infrastructure in a way that agreement care of les owned have extremely little, ” he aware reporters. Thailand cares about secure housing In 2000, Thailand ’ s mostly ineffective Urban Community Development Office integrated with another departments supports formulating the Community Organizations Development Institute, a appropriations found networking arm for poor communities. Three years later, government proceedings services improvement non formal agreements still lacked organization found scale, and 5, 500 low - income communities housing 8. 25 billion inhabitants in 300 municipalities remained. Then, the Thai ministers announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (“ secure housing ”) found Baan Us Arthorn (“ we supported ” ). The first provide subventions found micro loans services challenges poor conditions improve their housing climates, whereas the secondly constructed and commercialised subsidized flats and houses for slower - income authorities. From the starting, Thailand ’ s national slum initiative was grandly ambitious. In a 2005 interviews of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the planning reconceived “ how to achieve great - scale impacts by endorses local community - driven produces in each urban center, which, when incorporated together, achieve city and national scale. ” Now in its 4th year, upgrading efforts are either finished or under way in 949 poor corporation in 226 cities and involving some fifty three, 000 householders, according to CODI. A close look The variety of slum upgrading and resettlement efforts are legions, as are the degrees of their achievements. That yes why representatives from the World Bank, U. N. - Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development have in recent years arrived at a general consensus about what ’ s requesting for effective slum improvement or relocation: broad - set and sustained urban planning operations that respect found incorporate the views of the local poor; public - private industries initiatives; improvements that include, at a limits, land tenure and fundamental vices; found, if possible, dispassionate international benefits. That last point is exemplified by the World Bank ’ s conditional financings of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donor money conditional on equal functions could go a long way toward more effective proyectos. But despite the progress, inequitable communications are not unusual. South African governors efforts to evict millions of residents from a township just outside Cape Town in September 2006 were met with violent resistance. And just over a year after, some 20, 000 circumstances still faced eviction as a result of a multimillion - dollar agreements - backed housing project. The Cape Town scheme is not different to ongoing efforts in Durban and World Bank - supported evictions in Lagos, Nigeria. In later 2007, the Philippine governors, too, vowed benefits eliminate all squatter associations in 3s years ’ time, undermining forcible elimination for any that didn ’ t comply. “ I hope these relocations will slow, but the power of the vested interests within government and land boat owners is difficult to control, ” exactly Satterthwaite, appointing to Slum Dwellers International found local federations of the poor as crucial to separating forcible removals. The ups and downs of the Phnom Penh found Mumbai times also underscore the necessities to remain vigilant and pragmatic. “ Social found political forces supported by better inputs found improve communications, ” said the State of World Population 2007, “ will approved to come into play supports denounce deceitful and ruthless maneuvers that allowed stand in the way of improvement in the lives of the poor. ” Long a motivating element in the creation of cities, greed will continue benefits play a part in urban development, making the abusive tactics of developers and officials a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong communications represent about half of the original 5 - year goals, still a major achievement. Boonyabancha highlighted the project ’ s width. “ Working on a city - wide scale unexpectedly makes apparent the disagreements between all the slums within the same constituency, ” she wrote in her studying for the journal Environment found Urbanization. “ If the process recommendations managed correctly, suddenly all of these distinctions become a kind of university, environments people learn about provides own town. ” More importantly, the Thai initiatives were designed found favour by the poor yourselves, with governors subsidies and micro loans given directly services poor communities that then plan and implement housing and services improvements of their choosing. Many see this empowerment as integral to the plan ’ seconds success; Boonyabancha has called it “ a new politics of slum updating. ” “ This direction is only possible because people have doomed the groundwork firstly, ” she added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor doing their part, two prominent urban development report put the onus on local and national governments. “ Underneath nearly all aspects of urban development found poverty reduction are times of resources, ” Warah said in U. N. News Center repor. She noted to health care, teaching and basic service, found advocated stronger found more integrated governmental intervention. Satterthwaite existed encouraging signs. “ City found municipal governments are the key, ” he approximately. “ But national reforms that tightened local government capacity and accountability to their civics environmental, and some national arrangements have moved a long way to improving this. ” Satterthwaite pointed to government - slum dweller organisations in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India found the Philippines, noting that most projects had intervened created from the bottom up by communities of urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, contributors and NGOs could refocus their efforts to fomenting found nurture co operation enterprises between governments found urban poor communities. “ The only international agencies likely monitoring achieved impact on national and city governments are those with grave funding that these governments likes or need – and this means relatively few such agencies, ” said Satterthwaite. “ The real problem is that the large scale official assistance agencies and development banks are not very good at working direct with the urban poor and achieved not laid much precautions monitoring supporting the needed increasing in competence and capacity among city and municipal administrations; many official assistance agencies given no urban policy at all, and sweetest involved structures ill equipped monitoring support the means of pro - poor urban reforms that are needed. ” NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor found Cordaid have committed to construction and improving low - income urban sheltering. Most find the workshops tough but recognition. “ It is more difficult to integrate characteristics in urban where because it is an impenetrable environment, ” Helena Gayle, supervisors of CARE International, which has been working in Nairobi ’ proposing Kibera slum, said in a recent interview. “ Urban areas are dense; they are aggravated. It information not so much that the actual substance of the programmes will change — for instance we do village saving and loans but in urban settings they are called group savings and micro loans — but you just left a lot more complex interconnections to work with. ” Gayle also saw another problem. “ We benefit somewhat driven by who is actually providing governance for work in this matters, and we believe like here aren ’ t sufficient donors who recognize the requirements to look at urban poverty as a high priority, ” she said. This yes not news. In a 2003 journal arrangements, M. Vitor Serra, leading World Bank urban specialist, urged larger donor involvement in urban housing found land markets. He also recognized the following: learn from and incorporating the stances of the poor; scaling principles at the national level whilst devolving liability to local governments; found enhancing private partnerships. About a century ago, Jacob Riis, the muckraking journalist and champ of the poor, wrote that “ the slum is the measure of civilization. ” One wonders when we will learn.

Living in an overcrowded found unsanitary slum, suggests Warah ’ s report, is more lifetime - threatening than livelihoods in a poor rural village.

As of August 2007, nearly seventeen, 000 households have been relocated into their own proper residences with running waters, indoor toilets found utilities. Thailand concentrates about secure housing In 2000, Thailand ’ s mostly ineffectual Urban Community Development Office merged with another agency to form the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding and networking arm for poor worlds. Underneath nearly all steps of urban development and poverty reduction are issues of governance, Warah said in U. N. News Center repor.","When UPDF celebrated its 5th birthday with a gala event that May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy to provide secure land tenure and assisting in upgrading 100 informal settlement sustainability each year until all the city ’ s poor units had land tenure and full basic services. A joint program between the local government, international nongovernment organizations (U.

6,29211,"Turn to slums; the call for charity ""The weak'n' the strong' n'the rich' n'the poor get together and no longer tolerate more space. When someone disappears, you are crowded in the sky and you are down I don't know.""-Bob Dylan When the prophet of the people wrote these lyrics in 1962, he probably didn't know how accurate they were 45 years later. It could be the displaced Darfuri and his cousin making beds in Kattoum, a baby born in Rio de Janeiro, or an immigrant renting a house in Mumbai. But one day in the next few months, such daily events will mark the reorientation of human beings from primarily rural species to mostly urban species. This is just the beginning. The latest report of the United Nations on the global population predicts that by 2030, the urban population of 3.3 billion will increase to nearly 5 billion, most of which will occur in the poor in developing countries. Many people are unlikely to receive enough assistance. Assuming that urban residents have the ability to stand up, donor agencies and humanitarian organizations have conducted long-term training on poverty reduction in rural areas. Rasna Warah, author of the UN-Habitat report ""The State of the World's Cities"", admitted in a recent interview: ""Most institutions are biased towards the countryside."" ""Assuming that city dwellers will take care of themselves, cities are A prosperous island, so you don’t have to worry about city dwellers.” This makes some sense. According to a recent report by UN-Habitat and the International Institute of Environment and Society, due to increased infrastructure funding, women’s integration into the workforce and increased foreign investment, urban per capita income is often much higher than in rural areas in developing countries. development of. The problem is not urbanization itself, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. It is estimated that there are about 1 billion slum dwellers in the world today, and the United Nations predicts that it will increase by another 400 million by 2020. Residents of these growing urban poor are at the greatest risk of water scarcity, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. Walla’s report concluded: “Living in overcrowded, barren slums is more life-threatening than living in poor villages.” Walla added that these areas are “ignored by local authorities and development agencies.” . ""This is a complete blind spot."" In addition, the United Nations Population Fund believes that housing is the ""core of urban poverty."" Therefore, we turn to the most desperate urban housing, the slum, because it is eager to turn to the focus of aid and development. Empower the people: three situations In the early 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slums was people's power. Informal settlement community groups have united in the city, the country, and internationally to establish a federation capable of exerting social and political influence. In the past few years, these campaigns have become popular in more than 20 countries/regions and provided housing for millions of people. These campaigns have quietly become the most powerful and promising innovations in improving and eliminating slums in the world. Walla said: “The urban poor are passive at best, and at worst, they have no planning and implementation of slum upgrading projects.” She added that planners have begun to realize that the urban poor are “the most capable of defending their relative to the local The government has the right to design and implement slum upgrading plans.” Her recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia and Mumbai, India emphasized that this new direction, although promising, is not a panacea. Phnom Penh has taken two steps forward. Since the first democratic elections in Cambodia in 1993, and after the economic crisis and political stability after 1997, Phnom Penh’s investment and development have increased sharply, but it has also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 study found that more than 20% of the city's population (172,000 people) live in informal settlements, and about two-thirds of them have no toilets, water or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government established the Urban Poverty Development Fund to provide loans for relocation and housing needs. However, it was not until the ""Urban Development Strategy"" was announced in 2001 that the city really started to improve. A joint plan between local government, international non-governmental organizations (UN-Habitat and Asian Housing Rights Alliance) and the community (solidarity). For the Urban Poverty Federation, local chiefs and urban resource centers, the strategy has been adopted from the beginning Innovative methods, research from local communities and independent consultants before making any decisions. The survey results show that the previous relocation work failed because the plan was not made with the participation of the people, the resettlement site was not selected wisely, and the cost was not fully considered. In the end, the report only recommends relocation in rare cases, rather than promoting the upgrading and reconstruction of existing slums and settlements. Subsequent studies on land supply, relocation practices, and development possibilities were conducted, and after the study was completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and inclusive workshops. Therefore, a precedent has been set: this will be an initiative that will build relationships between different levels of society and administration, share knowledge, and adopt cooperative methods to improve the living conditions of the poor. By early 2003, several pilot projects had been successfully implemented. As the Uganda People’s Defense Force celebrated its fifth anniversary in May, Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy to provide safe land tenure and assist in upgrading 100 informal settlement communities every year until all impoverished communities in the city have ownership Land tenure and comprehensive basic services. Observers from both sides appreciated this progress. ""This reflects a constantly changing attitude,"" Mann Chhoeurnn, the head of the municipal cabinet, said at the event. ""The position of the poor as an important role in solving the urban housing problem is increasingly accepted by governments at all levels."" ""In this process in Phnom Penh, the poor are the agents of change. They are influencing the government and persuading the government to support what people want. People of things,"" Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asian Housing Rights Alliance, told reporters at the time. . ""The Prime Minister's announcement today represents a whole new direction. Now, Phnom Penh has a considerable number of urban poor people."" During this period, there have been successes-such as the recent land sharing settlement in a settlement called Borie Kiela- And failure. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 6,000 shack residents in Phnom Penh were evicted. The Cambodian Coalition for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than 100 Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their homes when government forces dismantled their living structures. The media and surveillance teams were barred from entering the site, and the expelled were given 4 x 10 meters of land at Trapeang Anh Chanh. The city is a flood-prone village on the outskirts of the city. Tap water, electricity, schools, health care or waste management systems. The biggest unpredictability of Mumbai Mumbai is a crowded, chaotic city, with serious poverty surrounding it. Mumbai is likely to be the perfect epitome of the needs, risks, wonders and complexity of urban life in the 21st century. Of the 18 million residents, about 8 million live in informal settlements or city streets. Several major reconstruction projects have reached billions of dollars. This is also an excellent testing ground for contemporary resettlement technology. (Please note that in India, states, not the central government, control housing and other infrastructure issues.) First is the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, which was launched in 2002 and cost US$945 million to upgrade and help the aging of densely populated cities And rapid transportation of equipment. With the support of a US$542 million loan provided by the World Bank, the project includes the relocation of 20,000 shanty towns and shanty towns along roads and railways, and is scheduled to be completed in 2008. All work was carried out as planned until the World Bank’s analysis at the beginning of 2006 found that the resettlement work was reduced below the previously established World Bank resettlement standards. As a result, the bank suspended financing in March. A few months later, state officials changed their plans and agreed to resettle people in the city, and then the bank renewed the payment. The second is the plight of the sidewalk. For decades, tens of thousands of urban poor people in Mumbai have lived on the streets and sidewalks in fragile temporary shelters without basic services for decades. In April 2006, these so-called sidewalk residents won a tough housing battle, and hundreds of people obtained the keys to their houses. Two local grassroots NGOs (National Slum Dwellers Initiative and Promotion of Regional Resource Center Association) and a women's group (Mahiramilan) have promoted the government for more than 20 years and achieved success at the end of 2004. The state government agreed to resettle nearly 100,000 pavement residents in the city on government-purchased land within the next two years. The key to the new homes in the suburbs of Mankud is the start-up of this policy. According to some estimates, the most divisive effort has to do with the development of Dharavi, Mumbai’s monster shantytown, home to one million residents. In recent years, living conditions have improved: residents have 24 hours of electricity and tap water a day, only one hour a day. About 70% of the buildings are used for commercial purposes, such as banks and restaurants; most residents are equipped with TVs, pressure cookers and gas stoves. But a controversial $2.5 billion Dharavi reconstruction plan is imminent. The plan was developed by local developer Mukesh Mehta in conjunction with the state government to develop plans for new hotels, offices, restaurants and universities. In October 2007, a report by the Indian publication Mint of the Wall Street Journal estimated that the Dharavi project may generate nearly $2.6 billion in revenue for the state government due to rising real estate prices in Mumbai. About 25 financiers and contractors from all over the world have begun bidding for this precious waterfront plot, even though the resettlement plan provides half of the estimated Dharavi residents. Jokin Arputham, chairman of the National Association of Slum Dwellers, participated in this project. ""In Dharavi, this is a real estate scam,"" Arputham, who helped promote fairness projects in South Africa, Malawi and India, told Frontier Magazine in June this year. ""It's pulling the same trick on the slums of the airport."" Arputham mentioned the fourth plan underway, which is to redevelop and expand Mumbai Airport. There are thousands of locals living around Mumbai Airport in crumbling homes. For more than 40 years. With the booming development of India and the increasing importance of real estate in Mumbai, its 276 acres of land prevailed. An eviction notice was issued to residents in February last year, but because there is no resettlement site or any restoration plan, they are unlikely to be evacuated anytime soon. A spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited said: ""The problem is that the government has not yet determined the land. Given the lack of land in Mumbai, this is a difficult task."" In October 2007, the relocation was awarded to a private company. The developer, the developer expects to relocate approximately 85,000 families to unidentified land, a process that may take up to four years. Returning to Dharavi, the government recently suspended the tendering process and cancelled the ambitious reconstruction plan, most likely in response to the anger of residents. David Satterthwaite, a senior researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said in November that the government is exploring ways to develop Dharavi in ​​cooperation with residents’ organizations, developers and non-governmental organizations. Satterthwiate said: ""I hope to reach a good compromise between the needs of the residents and the improvement of the Dharavi conditions needed."" Following the funding shortage in mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has also made considerable progress. As of August 2007, nearly 17,000 households have used tap water, indoor toilets and electricity to move to their suitable houses. According to the World Bank’s comments, the actual income and personal safety of many people are increasing. In November 2007, Robert Zoellick, President of the World Bank, visited a new settlement and expressed satisfaction. He told reporters: “It’s a great achievement to be able to advance critical transportation infrastructure in a way that cares for very few people.” Thailand is concerned about ensuring housing safety. In 2000, Thailand’s least efficient urban community development office cooperated with Another organization merged to form the Community Organization Development Institute, an organization that provides funds and builds networks for poor communities. Three years later, the government's efforts to improve informal settlements still lack organization and scale. There are still 5,500 low-income communities, with 8.25 million residents living in 300 cities. Then, the Thai government announced two new plans for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (""Safe Housing"") and Baan Us Arthorn (""We Care""). The former provides subsidies and loans to help poor communities improve the housing environment, while the latter builds and sells subsidized apartments and houses for low-income families. From the very beginning, Thailand's National Slum Initiative was ambitious. In a review of Baan Mankong in 2005, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, stated that the plan reimagined “how to achieve large-scale impact by supporting local community-driven processes in each city center, which are added to Together, they can reach the scale of cities and countries.” According to CODI data, by the fourth year, the upgrade has been completed or is in progress, and it is carried out in 949 impoverished communities in 226 cities, involving approximately 53,000 families. Carefully observe the variety of slum reconstruction and immigration work, and the degree of success is also great. This is why in recent years experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development have reached a general consensus on effectively improving the conditions required for slums or resettlement: respect and support broad-based sustainable urban planning initiatives to absorb local The opinions of the poor; public-private partnerships; improvements include at least land tenure and basic services; and provide as much selfless international assistance as possible. The last point is the case of the World Bank’s conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donor funds conditional on fair execution can greatly contribute to more effective projects. Despite progress, unequal policies are not uncommon. The South African government’s efforts to expel thousands of residents from a town outside Cape Town in September 2006 met with violent resistance. Just over a year later, about 20,000 residents were still evicted due to government-supported multi-million dollar housing projects. The Cape Town plan is no different from the ongoing efforts in the Nigerian Lagos deportation supported by Durban and the World Bank. In the second half of 2007, the Philippine government also vowed to eliminate all residents in all houses within three years and threatened to forcefully evict any residents who did not meet the requirements. Satterthwaite said: ""I hope these evictions can slow down, but the vested interests within the government and landowners are difficult to control,"" he pointed out that the international slum dwellers and local federations of the poor are the key to stopping forced repatriation. The ups and downs of Phnom Penh and Mumbai's efforts have also highlighted the need for vigilance and pragmatism. ""The State of World Population 2007"" stated: ""There must be better information and better communication to support social and political forces to condemn deceptive and relentless means that may hinder the improvement of the lives of the poor."" Greed has long been The driving force of urban construction, greed will continue to play a role in urban development, which makes the abuse of developers and officials a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data accounted for about half of the initial five-year target, but it is still a major achievement. Boonyabancha emphasized the breadth of the project. She wrote in a study in the journal Environment and Urbanization: “Working across the city will suddenly make the differences between all the slums in the same electoral district obvious.” “If the process is properly managed, All these differences will suddenly become a university where people can learn from their own city.” More importantly, Thailand’s initiative was designed and approved by the poor themselves. The government directly provided subsidies and loans to the poor, and then They come to plan and implement improvements to the housing and services of their choice. Many people see this authorization as a necessary condition for the success of the plan; Boonyabancha calls it ""the new politics of slum upgrading."" She added: “This direction is only possible after people do the basic work first.” Attracting the heavy hitters With the help of the urban poor, two outstanding urban development experts shifted the responsibility to the local and central governments. government. Walla reported in the UN News Center: “Almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction are governance issues.” She pointed to health care, education and basic services, and advocated stronger and more comprehensive government interventions. . Satterthwaite sees encouraging signs. He said: ""The municipal government is the key."" ""But national reforms to strengthen the capacity and accountability of local governments for citizens will help, and some governments have gone a long way to improve this."" Satterthwaite pointed out In addition, the governments of Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India, and the Philippines have partnered with slum dwellers, and pointed out that most projects are created by poor urban communities from the bottom up. He wanted to know whether policy makers, donors, and NGOs can adjust their work directions to promote and nurture cooperation projects between the government and poor urban communities. Satterthwaite said: ""The only international institutions that may have an impact on national and municipal governments are those that the government needs or need, and that have a lot of funding, which means that there are relatively few such institutions."" ""The real problem is that the large official Aid agencies and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor, and do not pay enough attention to supporting the growth of capacity and capacity between cities and municipal governments; many official aid agencies do not have urban policies at all, and most institutional facilities are not sufficient to support the needed Various poverty alleviation urban reforms."" Non-governmental organizations, such as Habitat, Misereor and Cordaid, have committed to building and improving low-income urban housing. Most people think that work is hard, but it is meaningful. Helena Gayle, the director of CARE International who has been working in the Kibera slums in Nairobi, said in a recent interview: “It is more difficult to integrate things in urban areas because it is an impenetrable environment.” Urban areas are dense; they are complex. The substance of these programs will not change too much. For example, we do rural savings and loans, but in an urban environment, they are called group savings and loans, but you can use more complex networks Gale also sees another problem. She said: “We are actually motivated by who actually provides work resources for the region. We feel that there are not enough donors to realize the need to make urban poverty a top priority. . ""This is not news. In a 2003 journal article, World Bank Chief Urban Expert M. Vitor Serra urged donors to participate more in urban housing and land markets. He also suggested the following: Learn from the poor and absorb their Viewpoints; expand the scale of projects at the national level while delegating responsibilities to local governments; and promote private partnerships. About a century ago, the gloomy journalist and poor advocate Jacob Riis wrote : ""Slums are the yardstick of civilization. ""Some people wonder when we will learn.

This is why in recent years experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development have reached a general consensus on effectively improving the conditions required for slums or resettlement: respect and support broad-based sustainable urban planning initiatives to absorb local The opinions of the poor; public-private partnerships; improvements include at least land tenure and basic services; and provide as much selfless international assistance as possible. ""The real problem is that large official aid agencies and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor, and do not pay enough attention to supporting the growth of capacity and capacity between cities and municipal governments; many official aid agencies do not have urban policies at all, and large Most institutional facilities are not enough to support the various poverty alleviation urban reforms needed."" ""In this process in Phnom Penh, the poor are the agents of change. They are the ones who influence the government and persuade the government to support what people want,"" Asia Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Housing Rights Alliance, told reporters at the time. . She added that planners have begun to realize that the urban poor are “the most capable of defending their rights relative to local governments and designing and implementing slum upgrading plans,” highlighting her recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia and Mumbai, India. This new direction, although promising, is not a panacea. “The position of the poor as an important role in solving urban housing problems is increasingly being accepted by governments at all levels.” Satterthwaite pointed to the partnership between the governments of Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India, and the Philippines with slum dwellers, and Point out that most of the projects are created from the bottom up by poor urban communities. He wanted to know whether policy makers, donors, and NGOs can adjust their work directions to promote and nurture cooperation projects between the government and poor urban communities. Two local grassroots non-governmental organizations (National Slum Dwellers Initiative and Promotion of Regional Resource Center Association) and a women's group (Mahilamilan) have promoted the government for more than 20 years and achieved success at the end of 2004. The state government agreed to relocate nearly 100,000 road residents in the city on government-purchased land within the next two years.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
7,29211,"A turn to the slums; a call for handouts ""The weak and the strong and the rich and the poor don't gather for more. Crowd up and crowd down, if someone disappears you never know."" - Bob Dylan When the People's Prophet wrote these texts in 1962, he probably had no idea how accurate they would be 45 years later. It could be a displaced Darfuri breaking up with his cousin in Khartoum, a baby born in Rio de Janeiro, or an immigrant renting an apartment in Mumbai. But one day in the coming months, such everyday events will mark the reorientation of humanity from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban species. And that is just the beginning. The most recent United Nations report on the world population predicts nearly 5 billion city dwellers by 2030 (up from 3.3 billion), with most of the increase being among poor people in developing countries. Many are unlikely to receive adequate help. Assuming city dwellers have a leg up, donor and humanitarian agencies have long trained rural poverty reduction efforts. ""Most agencies have a rural focus,"" said Rasna Warah of U.N. Habitat, author of the latest report on the state of the world's cities, in a recent interview. ""The assumption is that citizens of cities take care of themselves, that cities are islands of prosperity and that you don't have to worry about the city's residents."" There is some truth in that. According to UN-Habitat and a recently published report by the International Institute for the Environment and Environment, per capita incomes in cities are often significantly higher than in rural areas in developing countries due to higher infrastructure funding, the integration of women into the labor force and higher foreign investment Development. The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. It is estimated that today's slum dwellers live at around 1 billion today, with the United Nations forecasting an additional 400 million by 2020. Those living in this growing urban poverty are at the greatest risk of water scarcity, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. ""Living in an overcrowded and unsanitary slum,"" concludes Warah's report, ""is more life-threatening than living in a poor rural village."" These areas are ""neglected by local authorities and development agencies,"" added Warah. ""It's a total blind spot."" In addition, the U.N. Population finds that shelter is ""the core of urban poverty"". We therefore turn to the most desperate urban residential area, the slum, which yearns for a turnaround in the limelight for aid and development. Power for the people: three cases In the early 21st century, the zeitgeist of the slums is the power of the people. Groups of informal settlement communities have come together - within cities, countries and internationally - to create federations capable of exerting social and political influence. These movements, which have emerged in more than 20 countries in recent years and improved housing for millions, have tacitly become the most effective and promising innovation for improving and eradicating global slums. ""The urban poor have been passive recipients at best and, at worst, completely absent from planning and implementing slum modernization projects,"" Warah said. The planners have recognized that the urban poor ""are in the best position to stand up for their rights against local governments and to design and implement slum modernization programs,"" she added. Recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia and Mumbai, India underscore this new direction, which, while promising, is not a panacea. Two Steps Forward in Phnom Penh Since Cambodia's first democratic elections in 1993, and increasingly after the economic crisis and greater political stability after 1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh has risen sharply, but has also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 study found that more than 20 percent of the urban population - 172,000 people - lived in informal settlements, about two-thirds of which were without toilets, water, or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government established the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for resettlement and housing needs. However, the city improvement ball only began with the announcement of the urban development strategy in 2001. A joint program between the local government, international non-governmental organizations (UN-Habitat and the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights) and the community (Solidarity) For the Urban Poor Federation, which Local Chefs and the Urban Resource Center took an innovative approach to the strategy from the start, initiating a study of local communities and independent advisors before making any decisions. The results showed that previous resettlement efforts had failed because no plans had been made with the participation of the population, the resettlement sites had not been carefully selected, and the expenses had not been adequately considered. Ultimately, the report rarely recommended resettlement and instead advocated the modernization and rehabilitation of existing slums and settlements. Studies of land availability, evacuation practices and development opportunities followed. When these were completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and integrative workshops. This set the precedent: This would be an initiative that would build relationships between different levels of society and administration, share knowledge and use collaborative methods to improve the living conditions of the poor. Several successful pilot projects had been carried out by early 2003. When the UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event in May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy to ensure safe land use and support the upgrading of 100 informal settlement communities per year until all poor communities in the city own land and had full basic services. Observers from both sides welcomed the progress. ""This reflects a changed attitude,"" said cabinet chief Mann Chhoeurnn at the event. ""The position of poor people as key players in solving the city's housing problems is increasingly accepted by various levels of government."" ""In this Phnom Penh process, poor people are the agents of change, influencing the government and persuading them to support what the people want,"" Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, told reporters at the time. “Today's announcement by the Prime Minister is a whole new direction. There is now a critical mass of the urban poor in Phnom Penh. “In the meantime there have been successes - like a recent settlement to divide up the land in a settlement called Borie Kiela - as well as failures. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported the eviction of at least 6,000 residents of the Phnom Penh hut. And the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred Phnom Penh families were evicted from their homes when government forces destroyed their living structures. Media and surveillance groups were excluded from the site, and the displaced were given 4-by-10-meter plots in Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood-prone village on the outskirts of the city, with no running water, electricity, schools, health care or waste disposal systems. Maximum Unpredictability in Mumbai Mumbai is a crowded, chaotic city where terrible poverty meets great decadence. It is possibly the perfect microcosm for the demands and risks, wonders and complexities of urban life in the 21st century. With around 8 million out of 18 million people living in informal settlements or on city streets, and several large redevelopment plans ranging up to billions of dollars, it is also a good test bed for modern relocation techniques. (Note that in India, the states, not the national government, control housing and other infrastructure problems.) First up is the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $ 945 million plan initiated in 2002 to help the aging population to improve the run-down traffic of the densely populated city and support facilities. The project was supported by a World Bank loan of US $ 542 million and involves the relocation of 20,000 smelters and smelters along roads and railways. Completion is planned for 2008. Until an analysis by the World Bank in early 2006 showed that resettlement efforts were falling below the World Bank's previously established resettlement standards. As a result, the bank stopped funding in March. It was only after government officials changed plans a few months later and agreed to relocate people within the city that the bank renewed payments. Next comes the plight of the sidewalk dwellers. Across the city of Mumbai, tens of thousands of urban poor have lived on streets and sidewalks in fragile, temporary homes with no basic services for decades. In April 2006, these so-called sidewalk dwellers won a highly competitive apartment battle when hundreds were given keys to their own homes. Two local grassroots NGOs (the National Slum-Dwellers' Initiative and the Society for the Promotion of Resource Centers in the Region) and a women's collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years and achieved success in late 2004 when the State agreed to move all of the city's nearly 100,000 sidewalks onto government-acquired land over the next two years. The keys to new homes in the suburbs of Mankhurd were the first fruits of this policy. The most controversial effort, by some estimates, has to do with the development of Dharavi, Mumbai's monster shantytown, home to a million people. Living conditions have improved in recent years: residents have electricity and running water around the clock for one hour a day; About 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial purposes such as banks and restaurants. and most residents have a television, pressure cooker, and gas stove. However, a controversial $ 2.5 billion Dharavi recovery plan is looming. The plan was drawn up by local developer Mukesh Mehta in collaboration with the state and includes plans for new hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in the Wall Street Journal's Indian publication, The Mint, estimated that the Dharavi project could raise nearly $ 2.6 billion in the treasury due to soaring property prices in Mumbai. Around 25 financiers and builders from around the world have begun bidding for the coveted waterfront property, although relocation plans are estimated to include half of Dharavi's residents. Jokin Arputham, President of the National Slum Dwellers' Association, is one of the project's fighters. ""It's a real estate scam in Dharavi,"" Arputham, who helped implement fair projects in South Africa and Malawi and India, told Frontline Magazine last June. ""It's the same trick in the airport slums."" Arputham pointed to a fourth ongoing plan to redevelop and expand Mumbai Airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have lived in dilapidated homes for more than 40 years. As India is booming and real estate in Mumbai becomes more valuable by the day, their 276 acres represent prime land. Residents were notified of the eviction last February, but without a relocation location or rehabilitation package, they're unlikely to budge anytime soon. ""The problem is that the government has not yet identified the land, and that's a big task given the lack of land availability in Mumbai,"" said a spokesman for Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium set to develop the package. In October 2007, the move was awarded to a private property developer who expected the move of around 85,000 households to as yet unidentified land to take up to four years. Back in Dharavi, the government recently dropped its bidding process and withdrew its ambitious redevelopment plan, likely in response to residents' excitement. In November, Senior Fellow of the International Institute for Environment and Development, David Satterthwaite, said the government was looking at ways to develop dharavi in ​​collaboration with community organizations, developers and NGOs. ""Hopefully a good compromise will be found between the needs of the residents and the need to improve conditions in Dharavi,"" said Satterthwiate. And after the short-lived funding problem of mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has also made significant progress. By August 2007, nearly 17,000 households with running water, indoor toilets, and electricity had been relocated to their own homes. Real incomes have risen for many people along with personal security, according to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited one of the new resettlement sites and was satisfied. ""It is a good accomplishment to advance the critical transportation infrastructure so that people are served with very few people,"" he told reporters. Thailand Provides Safe Housing In 2000, Thailand's largely ineffective urban development bureau merged with another agency to form the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding and networking arm for poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlements were lacking in organization and scope, leaving 5,500 low-income communities of 8.25 million people in 300 cities. Then the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (""safe shelter"") and Baan Us Arthorn (""we care""). The first gave grants and loans to help poor communities improve their living environment, while the second built and sold subsidized apartments and houses for lower-income households. Thailand's national slum initiative was very ambitious from the start. In a 2005 review by Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the plan “How big an impact can be made by supporting local community processes in each urban center that, taken together, reach an urban and national scale. “In 949 poor communities in 226 cities, in which, according to CODI, around 53,000 households are involved, modernization efforts are currently being completed or carried out in the fourth year. A Closer Look The variety of efforts to modernize and relocate slums is legion, as is the level of their success. For this reason, experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development have in recent years achieved a general consensus on what is required for effective improvement or resettlement of slums: broad and sustainable urban development initiatives that and respect the views of the local poor; public-private partnerships; Improvements that include at least land ownership and basic services; and, if possible, dispassionate international aid. This last point is illustrated by the World Bank's conditional funding of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Donor reliance on fair implementation could go a long way towards making projects more effective. Despite the progress, unequal strategies are not uncommon. The South African government's efforts to evict thousands of residents from a community outside Cape Town in September 2006 met with fierce opposition. And just over a year later, around 20,000 residents were still being displaced due to a multi-million dollar government-sponsored housing project. The Cape Town program is not dissimilar to the ongoing effort in Durban and the World Bank-sponsored evictions in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government also promised to eliminate all squatter communities in three years and threatened eviction for those who fail to do so. ""I hope these evictions will slow, but the power of interest groups within the government and landowners is difficult to control,"" said Satterthwaite, citing Slum Dwellers International and local associations of the poor as keys to stopping forced removals. The ebb and flow of efforts in Phnom Penh and Mumbai also underscores the need to remain vigilant and pragmatic. ""Social and political forces that are supported by better information and improved communication,"" said the state of the world population in 2007, ""must come into play to denounce deceptive and reckless maneuvers that can stand in the way of improving the lives of the poor."" “Greed will long be a motivating factor in city creation and will continue to play a role in urban development, making abusive practices by developers and officials a constant challenge. In terms of Thailand, Baan Mankong's latest data represents roughly half of the original five-year targets, which is still a significant achievement. Boonyabancha highlighted the breadth of the project. “Working across the city suddenly reveals the differences between all slums within the same constituency,” she wrote in her study for Environment and Urbanization magazine. ""When the process is properly managed, all of these differences suddenly turn into a kind of university where people learn about their own city."" More importantly, the Thai initiatives were designed and approved by the poor themselves. Government grants and loans were given directly to poor communities, who then plan and implement improvements in the housing and services of their choice. Many see this empowerment as essential to the plan's success. Boonyabancha has called it ""a new policy of slum upgrading"". ""This direction is only possible because people laid the foundations first,"" she added. Attracting the Batsmen As the urban poor do their part, two prominent urban development experts call on local and national governments. ""There are governance issues under almost every aspect of urban development and the fight against poverty,"" Warah said in the U.N. News Center. She pointed to health care, education and basic services, and advocated stronger and more integrated government intervention. Satterthwaite saw signs of encouragement. ""City and local governments are key,"" he said. ""But national reforms that strengthen local government capacity and accountability to their citizens are helping, and some national governments have come a long way to improve this."" Satterthwaite pointed to partnerships between government and slum dwellers in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most projects were created from the ground up by communities of the urban poor. He wondered if policymakers, donors and NGOs could realign their efforts to promote and encourage collaborative projects between governments and urban poor communities. ""The only international agencies likely to influence national and city governments are those with serious funding that those governments want or need - and that means relatively few such agencies,"" said Satterthwaite. “The real problem is that the major official aid agencies and development banks do not work very well directly with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to helping city and local governments to build skills and capacity. Many official aid agencies have no city policy at all, and most of them have poorly equipped structures to support the necessary poor-friendly city reforms. “NGOs like Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid are committed to building and improving low-income urban housing. Most find the work difficult but rewarding. ""It's harder to integrate things into urban areas because it's an impenetrable environment,"" said Helena Gayle, director of CARE International, who worked in the Kibera slum in Nairobi, in a recent interview. “Urban areas are dense; You are complicated. It's not so much that the real substance of the programs will change - for example, we make village savings and loans, but in urban settings they are called group savings and loans - but you just have much more complex networks that you work with can. “Gayle also saw another problem. ""We are somewhat dependent on who actually allocates resources to work in this area, and we feel that there are not enough donors who recognize the need to make urban poverty a high priority,"" she said. This is not news. In a 2003 magazine article, M. Vitor Serra, the World Bank's leading urban specialist, called for greater donor involvement in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended: learning from and including the perspectives of the poor; Scaling projects at the national level with responsibility being transferred to local governments; and promoting private partnerships. About a century ago Jacob Riis, the damned journalist and champion of the poor, wrote that ""the slum is the measure of civilization"". One wonders when we will learn. Read more development aid news.","The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements.

Arputham referred to the fourth ongoing plan to renovate and expand Mumbai Airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have been living in explosive homes for more than 40 years. As India thrives and Mumbai’s properties are more valuable on a daily basis, their 276 acres represent the most important country. Residents were notified of deportations last February, but without a resettlement site or rehabilitation package, they probably won’t be budgeting soon. “The problem is that the government has not yet identified the country, and that is a huge task given the lack of land in Mumbai,” said a spokesman for the group’s Mumbai International Airport Limited. In October 2007, the company was granted a move to a private developer who expected it to take up to four years to relocate about 85,000 households to unknown land. Back in Dharavi, the government recently suspended the bidding process and supported an ambitious rehabilitation plan, probably in response to residents ’frustration. In November, David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the government was looking for ways to develop Dharavia in collaboration with residents ’organizations as well as developers and NGOs. “Hopefully, a good compromise will be reached between the needs of the residents and the necessary improvement in Dharavi’s conditions,” Satterthwiate said. After a short-term financial waste in mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has also shown significant progress. Since August 2007, almost 17,000 households have been relocated to their own homes with running water, indoor toilets and electricity. According to a World Bank study, real incomes have increased with many in addition to personal security. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited one of the new resettlement sites and expressed his satisfaction. ""It is a great achievement when I have been able to proceed with the critical transport infrastructure in a way that takes care of people who have very little,"" he said. Thailand Provides Safe Housing In 2000, Thailand's mostly inefficient urban development center merged with another agency to form the Community Organizational Development Institute, which is part of the funding and networking of poor communities. Three years later, of government efforts to improve informal settlements, there was still no organization and scale, and 5,500 low-wage communities with 8.25 million inhabitants in 300 cities remained. The Thai government then announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (""safe housing"") and Baan Us Arthorn (""we care""). The former provided subsidies and loans to help poor communities improve their living environment, while the latter built and sold subsidized housing and houses to low-income households. The Thai National Slum Initiative had been ambitious from the beginning. In a 2005 review by Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the plan set out “how to achieve large-scale impact by supporting local community management processes in each city center that, taken together, are achieved on a city and nation scale.” CODI said completed or underway in 949 poor communities in 226 cities with about 53,000 households. consensus on what is needed for the effective improvement or resettlement of slums: broad-based and sustainable urban planning initiatives that respect and include the views of local poor; chemicals; public-private partnerships; improvements including at least land ownership and basic services; and, if possible, desperate international aid. This last point is an example of World Bank conditional funding for the Mumbai urban transport project. Making donor money a condition for fair implementation could go a long way towards more effective projects. Despite progress, unequal policies are not uncommon. Efforts by the South African government to evict thousands of residents from a city outside Cape Town in September 2006 met with violent resistance. And just over a year later, about 20,000 residents were still forced to evict as a result of a multi-million dollar state-sponsored housing project. The Cape Town system is no different from the ongoing operations in Durban and the evictions supported by the World Bank in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government also promised to remove all squatter communities after three years by violently threatening anyone who did not comply. “I hope these evictions will slow, but the power of interests owned by governments and landowners will be difficult to control,” Satterthwaite said, pointing to the key to ending coercion by Slum Dwellers International and local poor unions. The ups and downs of the efforts of Phnom Penh and Mumbai also underscore the need to be vigilant and pragmatic. “Social and political forces, backed by better information and better communication,” said State of the World’s Population 2007, “must come to play in condemning deceptive and ruthless movements that can be an obstacle to the lives of the poor.” For a long time to come, greed will continue to be part In the case of Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represent about half of the original five-year targets, which is still a significant achievement. Boonyabancha emphasized the breadth of the project. "" between, ""he wrote in his study for Environmental and Urbanization."" If the process is managed properly, all of a sudden all of these differences will become a kind of university where people learn about their own city. ""More importantly, the poor themselves designed and approved the Thai initiatives. Government subsidies and loans were granted directly to poor communities that plan and implement improvements in housing and services of their choice. Many see this empowerment as an integral part of the success of the plan; Boonyabancha has called it a ""new policy of updating slums."" “This direction is only possible because people have done the groundwork first,” he added. Attracting Strong Beaters When the urban poor do their part, two well-known urban development experts place responsibility on local and national governments. “Almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction are governance issues,” Warah said in a review by the UN News Center. He referred to health, education and basic services and advocated stronger and more integrated state action. Satterthwaite saw encouraging signs. “City and municipal governments are key,” he said. ""But national reforms that strengthen the capacity and responsibility of local government for its citizens will help, and some national governments have come a long way in improving this."" Satterthwaite referred to partnerships between government and slum residents in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most projects had created bottom-up communities in poor cities. He wondered whether decision-makers, donors and NGOs could refocus their efforts to promote and nurture cooperation projects between governments and poor cities. “The only international agencies that are likely to have an impact on national and urban governments are those that have the serious funding these governments want or need - and that means relatively few such agencies,” Satterthwaite said. ""The real problem is that large official aid agencies and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to supporting the necessary skills and capacity building among cities and municipalities. Many official aid agencies have no urban policies at all, and most support pro-poor urban reforms. ”NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid are committed to building and improving low-income urban shelters. Most find the work difficult but rewarding. “Integrating housing into urban areas is more difficult because it is an impenetrable environment,” said Helena Gayle, director of CARE International, which worked in Kibera slums in Nairobi, in a recent interview. “Urban areas are dense; they are complex. It’s not so much that the actual content of the programs changes - for example, we do village savings and loans, but in an urban environment they are called group savings and loans - but you only have much more complex networks to work with. Gayle also saw another problem. “We’re somewhat guided by who actually provides the resources to work in this area, and we don’t think there are enough donors to recognize the need to prioritize urban poverty,” he said. This is not news. In a 2003 newspaper article, M.Vitor Serra, a World Bank urban expert, called for greater donor participation in the urban housing and land markets. He also recommended: learning from the perspectives of the poor and incorporating them; expanding projects at national level while transferring responsibility to local government; and the promotion of private partnerships. About a century ago, Jacob Riis, a tuber journalist and master of the poor, wrote that ""the slum is a measure of civilization."" One wonders when we learn. Read more development aid news.","The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. Living in an overcrowded and unhealthy slum, according to the Warah report, is more life-threatening than in a poor rural village. Power to the people: Three cases in the early 2000s in slums is the power of the people. By the beginning of 2003, a number of successful pilot projects had been completed. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported the eviction of at least 6,000 Phnom Penh shack residents. Arputham referred to the fourth ongoing plan to renovate and expand Mumbai Airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have been living in explosive homes for more than 40 years.

Thrown upside down and crowded down when nobody you ever know disappeared goes."" - Bob Dylan When people's prophet wrote those songs in 1962, he probably had no idea how right they would be after 45 years. It may be the displaced Darfuri with his cousin in Khartoum, a child born in Rio de Janeiro, or renting an apartment in Mumbai. But in the coming months, such everyday events will mark the revival of humanity, mainly from rural to mostly urban species. And this is just the beginning. The latest UN report on the global population predicts about 5 billion urban people from 3.3 billion to 2030, with the majority of the increase occurring among poor people in developing countries. Many are unlikely to receive adequate assistance. Assuming that townspeople have a leg up, donor agencies and humanitarian organizations have long trained poverty alleviation efforts in rural areas. ""Most agencies have a rural bias,"" acknowledged Rasna Varah of UN-Habitat, the most recent state author of cities in the world, in a recent interview. ""It is assumed that the citizens of the cities will take care of themselves, that the cities are islands of prosperity and therefore you need not bother with the inhabitants of the city."" There is some truth in this matter. According to recent reports by UN-Habitat and the International Institute for the Environment and UNI-Habitat reports, infrastructure funding, integration of women into the workforce and more foreign investment, urban per capita income is often much higher than rural areas in developing countries. development. The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. The United Nations puts today's global slum at around 1 billion, with an additional 400 million predicted by 2020. And the residents of these growing areas of urban poverty are at greatest risk of water scarcity, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. According to Varah's report, ""living in a congested and unnatural colony"" is more of a life-threatening threat than living in a poor rural village. ""Varah said these areas are neglected by local authorities and development agencies."" It is a blind spot. ""In addition, the US Population Fund argues that shelter is"" the core of urban poverty. ""Thus, we are looking at urban housing, The slums become the most desperate, as it longs for a diversion in the light of aid and development. People Power: Three Matters In the early 21st century, the people of the slum have power. Informal settlement Groups of communities are banding together in cities, countries and internationally to form associations to enable social and political conflict. Living in more than 20 countries and improving housing for millions over the past several years, These movements have quietly become the most powerful and promising innovations for reform and eradication on a global scale. Varah stated, ""The urban poor, the best, the passive recipients and, at worst, completely absent from the planning and implementation of slum upgrading projects Were. ""Planners have begun to realize that the urban poor"" for their rights Local governments are in the best position to advocate and implement slum-upgrade schemes, ”he added to recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia and Mumbai, India. , Underlines this new direction, which is promising, but is not a panacea. Since Cambodia's first democratic election in 1993, with two moves to Phnom Penh Hour and accelerating after the economic crisis and political stability since 1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh has grown rapidly but the urban poor have also been marginalized. have put. A 1997 study found that more than 20 percent of the city's population - 172,000 people - lived in informal settlements, of which about two-thirds were without toilets, water or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government formed the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for rehabilitation and housing needs. The urban reform ball did not really roll until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001. A joint program between local government, international NGOs (Asian Alliance for UN-Habitat and Housing Rights) and the community (solidarity) for the Urban Poor Federation, local heads and urban resource centers), the strategy has not made any decisions. The first employed an innovative approach, starting a study from local communities and independent consultants. Findings showed that previous relocation efforts had failed because plans were not taken up with people's participation, rehabilitation locations were not chosen wisely, and expenses were not adequately considered. Ultimately, the report recommended rehabilitation only in the rarest of cases, instead advocating the upgrade and redevelopment of existing slums and settlements. A study of land availability, eviction practices and development prospects, and when they were completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and inclusive workshops. Thus, the precedent was set: it would be an initiative that would build relationships between society and different levels of governance, share knowledge, and employ cooperative methods to improve the standard of living of the poor. In early 2003, several successful pilot projects were implemented. When the UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event in May, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy of acquiring land each year to secure 100 informal settlement communities and until all the city's poor The communities did not have tenure of land and complete basic services. Observers on both sides praised the progress. ""It reflects a changing attitude,"" city cabinet head Man Chhoyern said at the event. ""The status of poor people as important actors in solving the city's housing problems is increasingly accepted by various levels of government."" ""In the process of Phnom Penh, poor people are factors of change, they are about to influence the government and persuade people to support what they want,"" said Somsukh Boyonbancha, founder of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights. . “Today's announcement by the Prime Minister represents a completely new direction. Phnom Penh now has a significant group of urban poor. In the interim, there have been successes - such as recent land-splitting as well as failures in a colony called Bori Kila. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported the expulsion of at least 6,000 Phnom Penh slum dwellers. And the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their homes when government forces demolished their living structures. Media and surveillance groups were barred from the site, and evicted were given 4-by-10-meter plots in the flood-ravaged village, Trepinag Anh Chain, on the outskirts of the city, which provided water, electricity, Schools, without health care or on the outskirts of the city were affected by the floods. Waste Management System. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai, a congested, chaotic city in which terrible poverty puts an end to the grand collapse, may well be the true subtle form of the demands and risks, wonders and complexities of 21st century urban life. With approximately 8 million of the 18 million residents living in informal settlements or city streets, and several major redevelopment plans reaching billions of US dollars, it is also a good testing ground for contemporary rehabilitation techniques. (Note that in India, the states, the national government, do not regulate housing and other infrastructure issues.) The Mumbai Urban Transport Project, first introduced in 2002, is a $ 945 million plan for a densely populated city. To improve and assist aging and decaying transport has been initiated. Facilities. Supported by a $ 542 million loan from the World Bank, the project involves the rehabilitation of 20,000 huts and huts along roads and railways and is scheduled for completion in 2008. All went as planned until early 2006 until a World Bank analysis found that rehabilitation efforts fell below previously established World Bank rehabilitation standards. As a result, the bank suspended its financing that March. Several months later, state government officials paid a bank renewal to reorganize the people inside the city only after the plans were reshuffled. There is a plight of those living on the sidewalk. Around the city of Mumbai, tens of thousands of urban poor have lived on the streets and sidewalks for decades, without basic services, in fragile, temporary dwellings. In April 2006, these so-called sidewalk dwellers hard-won the housing battle when hundreds were given the keys to their homes. Two local grass-roots NGOs (National Slum-Dwellers Initiative and Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Center) and a women's collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years, and succeeded in late 2004, When the state agreed to house about 100,000 pavement residents of the city on land purchased by the government over the next two years. The key to that policy was the key to new homes in suburban Mankhurd. According to some estimates, the most divisive effort is to develop Dharavi, the demon Shantytown in Mumbai and home to one million inhabitants. Living conditions have improved in recent years: residents have 24 hours of electricity and running water for one hour every day; About 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial purposes such as banks and restaurants; And most residents have a TV, a pressure cooker and a gas stove. But a controversial $ 2.5 billion Dharavi redevelopment plan looms. The plan, developed by local developer Mukesh Mehta in collaboration with the state, plans for new hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. An October 2007 report in The Wall Street Journal's India publication, The Mint, estimated the Dharavi project to be about $ 2.6 billion in state government coffers due to rising real estate prices in Mumbai. Some 25 financiers and contractors around the world have begun bidding for prized waterway parcels, even providing rehabilitation schemes for an estimated half of Dharavi residents. Joaquin Arpatham, president of the National Slum Dollars Association, is among those struggling with the project. ""In Dharavi, it is a real estate scam,"" Arupatham, who has helped push through similar projects in South Africa and Malawi as well as India, told Frontline magazine in June. ""This is the same trick at the airport slums."" Arapatham mentioned a fourth ongoing plan for the redevelopment and expansion of the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of locals have lived in Ramshakal residences for more than 40 years. His 276 acres of land represents prime land, with India flourishing and Mumbai real estate being more valuable than the day. Residents were given eviction notices last February, but with no rehabilitation site or any rehabilitation package, they are unlikely to move soon. A spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited said, ""The problem is that the government has not yet identified the land and this is a huge task given the lack of availability of land in Mumbai."" In October 2007, the relocation effort was awarded to a private developer, who expected the process to relocate about 85,000 homes, allowing up to four years of as-yet unidentified land. Back in Dharavi, the government recently halted the bidding process and in response to residents' anger, discontinued its ambitious redevelopment plan. In November, David Fetterthwaite, senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the government was exploring ways to develop Dharavi in ​​association with residents' organizations as well as developers and NGOs. ""Hopefully, there will be a good agreement between the needs of the residents and the necessary improvement in conditions in Dharavi,"" Satterthwiate said. And after a short-term funding hiccup in mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project has shown considerable progress. As of August 2007, approximately 17,000 households have been moved to their own proper homes with water, indoor toilets and electricity. According to a World Bank review, real income has increased for many with personal security. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zaulik visited one of the new rehabilitation sites and pleased himself. He told reporters, ""This is a significant achievement to be able to move forward with significant transportation infrastructure. Thailand cares about safe housing. In 2000, Thailand's mostly ineffective Urban Community Development Office developed the Community Organizations Institute Merged with another agency, which is a financing and networking arm for poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlements still lack organization and scale, and in 300 cities 5,500 Housing for low-income communities is 8.25 million inhabitants. Then, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Ban Mankong (""safe housing"") and Ban as Arthorn (""we care""). Helping poor communities The first to provide subsidies and loans, while the second was to build and sell flats and homes for low-income homes. From the beginning, Thailand's national slum initiative was highly ambitious. In 2005, a review by Baan Mankong In, Boonebancha, one of its designers said that the plan ""A. A How to achieve large-scale impact by supporting local community-driven processes in the urban center that, when added together, achieve city and national scale ”. ""According to CODI, in its fourth year, upgrading efforts have either ended or are included in 949 poor communities in 226 cities and some 53,000 households. A closer look is the diversity of slum upgrading and rehabilitation efforts, such as He has a degree of success. This is why in recent years experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat, and the International Institute for Environment and Development have reached a general consensus on what is required for effective slum improvement or rehabilitation: respect-based comprehensive and sustained urban planning initiatives. Incorporating the views of the local poor; Public-private sector partnership; Reforms, including minimums, land tenure and basic services; And, if possible, distribute international aid. This last point is exemplary from the World Bank Conditional Fund of Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Making donor money conditional on similar implementation can go a long way toward more effective projects. But despite progress, uneven policies are not uncommon. In September 2006, the South African government's efforts to evict thousands of residents from a settlement outside Cape Town met with violent resistance. And just over a year later, some 20,000 residents still suffered evictions as a result of a multi-million-dollar government-backed housing project. The Cape Town plan is not a disservice to the ongoing efforts in the expulsion backed by Durban and the World Bank in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government also vowed to end all squatter communities in three years' time, not threatening to forcibly remove any compliance. ""I expect these evictions will slow, but the power of vested interests between the government and landowners is difficult to control,"" said Sterwellite, pointing to Slum Dollars International and the local unions of the poor, who forcibly removed Let's stop. The ups and downs of Phnom Penh and Mumbai efforts also underscore the need to remain alert and pragmatic. The State of World Population 2007 said ""social and political forces have supported better information and better communication"", playing to condemn the deceitful and ruthless maneuvers that may stand in the way of improving the lives of the poor. ""A motivating factor in building cities for a long time, greed will continue to play a role in urban development, challenging the abusive practices of developers and authorities. For Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data half of the original five-year goals Represents, still a significant achievement. Boyinabancha highlighted the breadth of the project. ""Working on a city-wide scale suddenly makes the distinction between all slums within the same constituency,"" he Written in his study for the journal Environment and Urbanism. ""If the process is managed properly, all of these differences suddenly become a kind of university where people learn about their city."" Importantly, the Thai initiatives were designed and approved by the poor themselves, with government grants and loans to the poor, who then plan and implement improvements to the housing and services of their choosing. Empowerment as an integral part of the success of the scheme lets see; Bonibandha called it ""a new politics of slum upgrade"". ""This direction is possible only because people have done groundwork before,"" he said. With the urban poor doing their part, attracting heavy hiccups, two prominent urban development experts emphasized local and national governments. According to Varah, representative of the UN News Center, almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction are governance issues. She pointed to health care, education and basic services and advocated stronger and more integrated government intervention. Satterthwaite saw encouraging signs. ""City and municipal governments are predominant,"" he said. ""But national reforms that strengthen the capacity of local government and accountability to their citizens, and some national governments have come a long way to improve it."" Satterthwaite pointed to the participation of government-slums in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most of the projects were built from below by communities of the urban poor. He wondered whether policymakers, donors and NGOs could reclaim their efforts to promote and nurture cooperative projects between governments and urban poor communities. ""Only international agencies are likely to have an impact on national and city governments with serious funding that these governments want or need - and that means there are few such agencies,"" Satterthwaite said. ""The real problem is that large government support agencies and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor and they did not pay much attention to supporting the necessary increase in capacity and capacity between city and municipal governments is; Many government support agencies have no urban policy at all, and most have ill-proclaimed ill-favored types of pro-urban reforms that are necessary.

""We are providing resources to work in this area to some extent, and it seems to us that we do not have enough donors who recognize the need to see urban poverty as a high priority."" This is not news. In a 2003 journal article, M. Vittor Serra, World Bank urban expert, urged greater donor participation in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended the following: learning and engaging the perspectives of the poor; Scaling projects at the national level by delegating responsibility to local governments; And promoting private participation.

Freezing at the top and crowded at the bottom, when someone you never know disappears” - Bob Dylan When a prophet of the people coined these poems in 1962, he probably had no idea about How accurate is it after 45 years. It may be a displaced person from Darfur staying with his cousin in Khartoum, a child born in Rio de Janeiro, or a migrant who rents an apartment in Mumbai. But one day in the coming months, such daily events will mark the reorientation of humanity from a predominantly rural type to a predominantly urban one. And that's just the beginning. The latest United Nations report on world population projects nearly 5 billion urban residents by 2030, up from 3.3 billion, with the majority of the increase occurring among the poor in the developing world. It is unlikely that he will receive much enough aid. Assuming that urban dwellers have a leg, donor agencies and humanitarian organizations have long trained poverty alleviation efforts in rural areas. “Most agencies have a rural bias,” Rasna Warah of UN-Habitat, author of the latest State of the World's Cities report, acknowledged in a recent interview. “City citizens are supposed to care about themselves, and cities are islands of prosperity, so you don't need to care about city dwellers.” There is some truth to that. Due to increased infrastructure financing, inclusion of women in the workforce and increased foreign investment, per capita income in urban areas is often much higher than per capita income in rural areas of the developing world, according to UN-Habitat and a recent report from the International Institute for Environment and Development. The problem is not the urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. It is estimated that the number of slum dwellers in the world today is about one billion, and the United Nations expects an additional 400 million people by 2020. People living in these growing pockets of urban poverty face the greatest risks of water scarcity, disease, violence, illiteracy and malnutrition. The Warah report concludes that ""living in an overcrowded and unsanitary slum is more dangerous to life than living in a poor rural village."" Warrah added that these areas were ""neglected by local authorities and development agencies."" ""It's quite a blind spot."" Moreover, UNFPA believes that shelter is at the ""core of urban poverty"". And so, we turn to our most desperate urban dwellings, the slums, where they crave a shift in the spotlight on aid and development. Power to the People: Three Cases In the early 2000s, the zeitgeist of the slum was the power of the people. Groups of informal settlement communities have united together - within cities, countries, and internationally - to create federations capable of wielding social and political influence. These movements have emerged in more than 20 countries and housing has improved by millions over the past several years, and have quietly become the most effective and promising innovations to improve and eliminate global slums. “The urban poor were, at best, passive recipients, and at worst, completely absent from the planning and implementation of slum upgrading projects,” Warah said. Planners are beginning to realize that the urban poor are ""in the best position to defend their rights to local governments, design and implement slum upgrading plans,"" and recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia, and Mumbai, India, confirm this new trend, which, although promising, is not Panacea. Two steps forward in Phnom Penh Since Cambodia's first democratic elections in 1993 and increasingly after the economic crisis and greater political stability after 1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh have risen sharply, but they have also marginalized the urban poor. A 1997 study found that more than 20 percent of the city's population - 172,000 people - lived in informal settlements, about two-thirds of them without toilets, water, or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government set up the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for resettlement and housing needs. But the urban improvement ball did not really begin to roll until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001. A joint program between local government, international NGOs (UN-Habitat and the Asian Housing Rights Alliance) and the community (solidarity for UFP, local leaders and the Urban Resource Center) ), The strategy used an innovative approach from the start, initiating a study from local communities and independent advisors before any decisions were made. The results revealed that previous relocation efforts had failed because plans were not undertaken with the participation of the people, resettlement sites were not chosen wisely, and expenditures were not sufficiently considered. Ultimately, the report recommended resettlement only in rare cases, and instead called for the improvement and redevelopment of existing slums and settlements. Studies on land availability, evacuation practices, and development potential were followed, and when they were completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and comprehensive workshops. Thus, the precedent was set: this would be an initiative that would build relationships between different levels of society and administration, share knowledge, and use cooperative methods to improve the living conditions of the poor. By early 2003, several successful pilot projects had been implemented. When the UPDF celebrated its fifth anniversary with a festive event in May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy to provide secure land tenure and assist in the development of 100 informal settlement communities every year so that all poor communities in the city have full access to land and basic services. Observers on both sides hailed the progress. ""This reflects the changing position,"" Municipal Prime Minister Man Choyorn said at the event. ""The position of the poor as important actors in solving housing problems in the city is becoming increasingly accepted by various levels of government."" “In this process in Phnom Penh, the poor are the agents of change, and they are the ones who influence the government and persuade it to support what the people want,” Somsk Bunyapancha, founder of the Asian Housing Rights Alliance, told reporters at the time. . Today's announcement by the Prime Minister represents a completely new trend. A critical mass of the urban poor is now in Phnom Penh. ”Meanwhile, there have been successes - such as the recent land-sharing settlement in a settlement called Buri Kila - as well as failures. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 6,000 people were evicted A resident of shantytowns in Phnom Penh. The Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights recently reported that more than a hundred families in Phnom Penh were forcibly evicted from their homes when government forces demolished their living buildings. Media and watch groups were banned from the site, and people who were given Evacuating 4 x 10m plots of land in Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood-prone village on the outskirts of the city without running water, electricity, schools, healthcare or waste management systems Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A busy, chaotic city where poverty borders Extreme Great Decadence, Mumbai may be the perfect microcosm of the demands and risks, wonders and complexities of urban life in the twenty-first century. With around 8 million of the 18 million residents living in squatter settlements or on city streets, and several major redevelopment plans amounting to billions of US dollars, it is also a good testing ground for contemporary resettlement technologies. (Note that in India, the states, not the national government, control housing and other infrastructure issues.) First is the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, which is a $ 945 million plan that began in 2002 to modernize and help the dilapidated and dilapidated transportation of the overcrowded city. Populated. Facilities. Supported by a $ 542 million loan from the World Bank, the project includes moving 20,000 huts and huts along roads and railways to completion in 2008. They all went as planned until World Bank analysis in early 2006 showed that restoration efforts Resettlement has fallen below the previously established World Bank resettlement benchmarks. As a result, the bank suspended its financing in March. Only after state government officials changed plans several months later and agreed to resettle people within the city, did the bank renew the payments. Next is the plight of the sidewalk residents. Across Mumbai, tens of thousands of urban poor have been living on the streets and sidewalks for decades, in makeshift and fragile housing without basic services. In April 2006, these so-called dock residents won a heated housing battle when hundreds of people got the keys to their homes. Two local grass-roots NGOs (the National Slum Population Initiative and the Association for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers) and a women's group (Mahila Milan) have pushed the government for more than 20 years, and had a hit in late 2004, when the state agreed to house all of the city's adult residents. They numbered around 100,000 people on land that the government purchased over the next two years. The keys to new homes in the suburbs of Mancord were the first fruits of that policy. The most divisive effort concerns the development of Dharavi, Mumbai's monster shantytown of one million people, according to some estimates. Living conditions have improved in recent years: residents have access to electricity and running water 24 hours a day, for one hour a day; About 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial purposes such as banks and restaurants; Most of the residents have a television set, pressure cooker and gas stove. But a controversial $ 2.5 billion redevelopment plan from Dharavi looms. Developed by local developer Mukesh Mehta in cooperation with the state, the plan draws up plans for hotels, offices, restaurants and the new university. An October 2007 report in the India publication of The Wall Street Journal, The Mint, estimated that the Dharavi project could bring nearly $ 2.6 billion into state government coffers due to soaring property prices in Mumbai. About 25 financiers and contractors from around the world have begun bidding for a valuable piece of land on the waterfront even as resettlement plans become available for an estimated half of Dharavi’s population. Jocken Arbotham, president of the National Slum Dwellers Association, is among those fighting the project. ""At Dharavi, it's a real estate scam,"" Arbotham, who has helped push fair projects in South Africa and Malawi as well as India, told Frontline Magazine last June. ""It does the same trick on the airport slums."" Arbotham pointed to a fourth ongoing plan to redevelop and expand Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals have lived in dilapidated housing for more than 40 years. With India booming and property values ​​in Mumbai increasing day by day, 276 acres represent prime land. Residents received eviction notices in February, but with no resettlement site or any rehabilitation package, they are unlikely to budge soon. A spokesman for the Mumbai International Airport Association Limited, which is set to develop the consortium, said, ""The problem is that the government has not yet identified the land, and this is a huge task given the lack of land in Mumbai."" In October 2007, the resettlement effort was awarded to a private developer, who predicted that it would take up to four years to move some 85,000 families to hitherto undefined land. Back in Dharavi, the government recently halted the bidding process and rolled back its ambitious redevelopment plan, likely in response to residents' outrage. In November, David Satterthwaite, Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the government was exploring ways to develop Daravi in ​​cooperation with population organizations as well as developers and NGOs. ""We hope that a good compromise will be found between the needs of the population and the improvement required in conditions in Dharavi,"" Satterthwaite said. After stalling short-term funding in mid-2006, the Mumbai urban transportation project also showed significant progress. As of August 2007, approximately 17,000 families had been moved into their own homes with running water, indoor toilets, and electricity. Real incomes have increased for many along with personal security, according to a World Bank review. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited a new resettlement site and expressed his happiness. ""It's a wonderful achievement to be able to advance the critical transportation infrastructure in a way that counts for people who have very little,"" he told reporters. Thailand Focuses on Safe Housing In 2000, the Ineffective Urban Community Development Bureau of Thailand merged with another agency to form the Community Organization Development Institute, which is the financing and networking arm of poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlements still lack organization and scope, and 5,500 low-income communities remain home to 8.25 million people in 300 cities. Then, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (""Safe Housing"") and Baan Us Arthorn (""We Care""). The first provided subsidies and loans to help poor communities improve their housing environments, while the second built and sold subsidized apartments and homes to low-income families. From the start, the Thailand National Slum Initiative was very ambitious. In a 2005 review of Baan Mankong, Boonyabancha, one of its designers, said the plan has re-imagined “how to achieve large-scale impacts by supporting community-led processes in each urban center, which, when added together, achieve city and national scale now.” In its fourth year, development efforts have completed or are underway in 949 impoverished communities in 226 cities and home to about 53,000 households, according to CODI. Close Look The diversity of slum upgrading and resettlement efforts the Legions are, and so are their degrees of success. It is for this reason that experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat, and the International Institute for Environment and Development have in recent years reached a general consensus on what is needed to effectively improve or relocate slums: large-scale and sustainable urban planning initiatives that respect and incorporate the views of the local poor; Public-private partnerships; Improvements that include, at a minimum, land tenure and basic services; If possible, impartial international assistance. This last point is embodied in the World Bank's conditional financing of the Mumbai urban transportation project. Making donor funds conditional on fair implementation can go a long way toward more effective projects. But despite the progress made, unfair policies are not uncommon. Efforts by the South African government to evacuate thousands of residents from a town just outside Cape Town in September 2006 met with violent resistance. Just over a year later, some 20,000 residents are still facing eviction as a result of a multi-million dollar government-backed housing project. The Cape Town plan is no different from the ongoing efforts in Durban and the World Bank-supported evacuations in Lagos, Nigeria. In late 2007, the Philippine government also pledged to wipe out all slum communities within three years, threatening the forcible removal of those who did not comply. ""I hope these evictions slow down, but it is difficult to control the power of vested interests within government and landowners,"" said Satterthwaite, pointing to the International Slum Dwellers Federation and local federations of the poor as the key to halting the forced removals. The vicissitudes of Phnom Penh and Mumbai efforts also underscore the need to remain vigilant and realistic. “Social and political forces backed by better information and improved communication,” said the State of World Population 2007 Report, “must play a role in denouncing the deceitful and cruel maneuvers that can stand in the way of improving the lives of the poor.” Greed has always been a catalyst in creating cities, and it will continue to exist. Playing a role in urban development, which makes abusive practices of developers and officials a constant challenge. For Thailand, Baan Mankong's latest data accounts for about half of the original five-year goals, and it's still a huge achievement. Boonyabancha highlighted the project's breadth. ""Acting at a large scale for the city suddenly demonstrates the differences between all the slums within the same district,"" she wrote in her study for the journal Environment and Urbanization. ""If the process is managed properly, all of these differences suddenly become a kind of university, as people learn about their city."" Most importantly, Thai initiatives are designed and approved by the poor themselves, with government subsidies and loans being provided directly to poor communities who then plan and implement housing improvements and services of their choice. Many see this empowerment as integral to the plan's success; Boonyabancha has called it a ""new slum upgrading policy"". ""This trend is only possible because people did the basic work first,"" she added. Attracting big hitters With the urban poor doing their part, two prominent urban development experts put the responsibility on local and national governments. “Underneath nearly every aspect of urban development and poverty reduction are issues of governance,” Wrah said in the UN News Center report. It cited health care, education, and basic services, and called for stronger and more integrated government intervention. Satterthwaite saw encouraging signs. “City and municipal governments are the key,” he said. ""But national reforms that strengthen local government capacity and accountability to their citizens are helping, and some national governments have gone a long way to improve this."" Satterthwaite referred to partnerships between government and slum dwellers in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, noting that most projects have been created from the bottom up by communities of the urban poor. He asked whether policymakers, donors and NGOs could redirect their efforts to promote and nurture collaborative projects between governments and poor urban communities. “The only international agencies that are likely to have an impact on national and city governments are those with serious funding that these governments want or need - and that means relatively few of these agencies,” Satterthwaite said. The real problem is that large official aid agencies and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to support the required increase in efficiency and capacity between city and municipal governments; many official aid agencies do not have an urban policy at all, and most of them have Structures not equipped to support the kinds of urban reforms needed in favor of the poor. "" NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor, and Cordaid have committed to building and improving urban shelters for low-income people. Most of them find it difficult to operate but it is rewarding. ""It's difficult to integrate things into urban areas because it's an impenetrable environment,"" Helena Gayle, the director of CARE International, who has been working in Nairobi's Kibera slum, said in a recent interview. “Urban areas are dense; They are complicated. It's not about changing the actual content of programs - for example, we do savings and village loans but in urban areas it's called savings and group loans - but you have more complex networks to work with. Jill saw another problem. “We are somewhat driven by whoever actually provides the resources to work in this area, and we feel that there are not enough donors who recognize the need to view urban poverty as a top priority,” she said. In an article published in the magazine in 2003, M. Vitor Serra, the World Bank's Principal Urban Affairs Specialist, urged greater donor participation in urban housing and land markets. He also recommended the following: Learning from the perspective of the poor and including them. Patriotic with the transfer of responsibility to local governments; and the promotion of private partnerships. For nearly a century, Jacob Rees, a deceptive journalist and champion of the poor, wrote that “Slums are the measure of civilization.” One wonders when we will learn.

Groups of informal settlements come together in cities, countries and internationally to form federations with social and political influence. These movements, emerging in more than 20 countries and improving the homes of millions of people over the past few years, have quietly become the most powerful and promising innovation for global slum improvement and destruction. ""The urban poor, at best, were passive buyers and, at worst, completely lacking in planning and implementing slum renovation projects,"" Warah said. With recent efforts in Thailand, Cambodia and Mumbai, India, planners have begun to realize that the urban poor are ""in the best position to advocate for their rights against local governments and to design and implement slum improvement plans."" Highlight this new direction, which, although promising, is not a panacea. Two steps ahead in Phnom Penh Since Cambodia's first democratic elections in 1993, and after the economic crisis and further political stability after 1997, investment and development in Phnom Penh have increased sharply, marginalizing the urban poor. A 1997 study found that more than 20 percent of the city's population - 172,000 people - live in informal settlements, and about two-thirds of them do not have toilets, no water or permanent housing. In 1998, the Cambodian government established the Urban Poor Development Fund to provide loans for relocation and housing needs. But the urban improvement ball didn't really start to roll until the City Development Strategy was announced in 2001.

For the Federation of the Urban Poor, local chiefs and the Urban Resource Center), the strategy used an innovative approach from the outset, launching a work from local communities and independent consultants before taking any decisions. The findings revealed that previous resettlement efforts had failed because plans were not implemented with public participation, resettlement sites were not chosen wisely, and costs were not adequately considered. As a result, the report only suggested relocation in the rarest of cases, but instead advocated the improvement and redevelopment of existing shantytowns and settlements. Work on land availability, evacuation practices and development possibilities was monitored, and when completed in May 2002, the results were analyzed and discussed in a series of large and inclusive workshops. The precedent was thus set: it would be an initiative to establish relationships between different levels of society and government, to share knowledge, and to apply collaborative methods to improve the living conditions of the poor. In early 2003, several successful pilot projects were implemented.

""The statement made by the prime minister today represents a completely new direction. There is now a significant mass of urban poor in Phnom Penh."" Meanwhile, successes - like a recent land-sharing deal in a settlement called Borie Kiela - have also been failures. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 6,000 Phnom Penh lodges had been evacuated. And the Cambodian Association for Human Rights and Advocacy recently reported that more than one hundred Phnom Penh families were forcibly evicted from their homes when government forces destroyed their living quarters. Media and monitoring groups were prevented from entering the site, and evacuees were given 4 by 10 meters of plots in Trapeang Anh Chanh, a flood-prone village on the outskirts of town without water, electricity, schools, health services or health services. waste management systems. Maximum unpredictability in Mumbai A crowded, chaotic city where dire poverty is adjacent to the great collapse, Mumbai can be a perfect microcosm of the demands and risks, wonders and complexities of 21st century urban life. With around 8 million 18 million residents living in informal settlements or city streets, and several major redevelopment plans reaching billions of US dollars, it is also a good testing ground for contemporary resettlement techniques. (In India, states, not national government, control housing and other infrastructure issues.) First, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, a $ 945 million plan launched in 2002 to improve and support the aging and weathered transport of the densely populated city. facilities. The project, backed by a $ 542 million loan from the World Bank, involves the relocation of 20,000 slums and slums along highways and railways and is slated for completion in 2008. below the previously set World Bank resettlement standards. As a result, the bank suspended its funding that March. But after state government officials changed plans a few months later and agreed to relocate people in the city, the bank renewed the payments. Next is the situation of the pavement dwellers. Throughout Mumbai city, tens of thousands of urban poor have been living on the streets and sidewalks for decades, in fragile, temporary housing lacking basic services. In April 2006, these so-called pavement dwellers won a tough housing battle when hundreds were given the keys to their homes. Two local community NGOs (the National Slum Residents Initiative and the Association for Supporting Regional Resource Centers) and a women's collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years and were successful in late 2004. The state agreed to host the city's approximately 100,000 pavement residents on government-purchased land over the next two years. The key to new homes in the Mankhurd suburb was the first fruit of this policy. By some estimates, the most divisive effort is about developing Mumbai's monster slum and Dharavi, which has a million residents. Living conditions have improved in recent years: residents have 24-hour electricity and running water for one hour every day; About 70 percent of the buildings are used for commercial purposes such as banks and restaurants; Most residents have a TV, pressure cooker and gas hob. But a controversial $ 2.5 billion Dharavi Redevelopment Plan looms. Developed by local developer Mukesh Mehta with the state, the plan sets out plans for new hotels, offices, restaurants and a university. A report published in The Wall Street Journal's Indian publication The Mint in October 2007 estimates that the Dharavi project could bring about $ 2.6 billion to the state government coffers due to rising property prices in Mumbai. Although the resettlement plans provide an estimated half of Dharavi residents, about 25 financiers and contractors from around the world have begun bidding for valuable beach parcels. Jokin Arputham, president of the National Slum Residents Association, is among those struggling with the project. ""It's a real estate fraud in Dharavi,"" Arputham told Frontline Magazine last June, who helped advance fair projects in India as well as South Africa and Malawi. ""The airport is doing the same in slums."" Arputham cited an ongoing fourth plan to redevelop and expand the Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals lived in dilapidated housing for over 40 years. With the Indian boom and Mumbai real estate becoming more and more valuable, 276 acres represent prime land. Residents were given evacuation notices last February, but without a resettlement site or any rehabilitation package, they are unlikely to be relocated soon. ""The problem is that the government has not yet defined the land, and this is a huge task as there is no land availability in Mumbai,"" said a spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited, the consortium planning to develop the parcel. In October 2007, the resettlement effort was given to a private contractor who expected it to take up to four years for approximately 85,000 households to move to yet unidentified land. When he returned to Dharavi, the government recently halted the bidding process and withdrew its ambitious redevelopment plan, likely in response to residents' anger. In November, David Satterthwaite, Senior Fellow of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the government is exploring ways to develop Dharavi in ​​collaboration with residents' organizations as well as developers and NGOs. ""Hopefully, a good compromise will be reached between the residents' needs and the necessary improvement in conditions in Dharavi,"" said Satterthwiate. And after the short-term funding hiccup in mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project also made significant progress. As of August 2007, nearly 17,000 households have moved into their own homes with running water, indoor toilets, and electricity. According to a World Bank review, real incomes have increased with personal safety for many. In November 2007, World Bank President Robert Zoellick visited one of the new resettlement sites and expressed his satisfaction. ""It is a nice achievement to be able to move forward with critical transport infrastructure to deal with people who have very little,"" he told reporters. Thailand cares about safe housing In 2000, Thailand's mostly ineffective Office for Urban Community Development merged with another agency to create the Community Organizations Development Institute, a funding and network arm for poor communities. Three years later, government efforts to improve informal settlements still lacked organization and scale, and there remained 5,500 low-income communities in 300 cities, home to 8.25 million inhabitants. Later, the Thai government announced two new programs for the urban poor: Baan Mankong (""safe housing"") and Baan Us Arthorn (""we care""). First, it provided subsidies and loans to help poor communities improve their housing environments, while the latter built and sold subsidized apartments and houses for low-income households. From the beginning, Thailand's national slum initiative was ambitious. In a 2005 review by Baan Mankong, one of its designers, Boonyabancha, said the plan “how to achieve large-scale effects by supporting local community-driven processes in each city center and, when combined, reach the city and national scale. . ""According to CODI, now in its fourth year, rehabilitation work is either completed or ongoing in 949 poor communities in 226 cities and encompassing about 53,000 households. A closer look The variety of slum remediation and resettlement efforts are legions, such as the degrees of their success. Experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat and the International Institute for Environment and Development reached a general consensus on what is needed for effective slum remediation or resettlement: broad-based and sustainable urban planning initiatives that respect the joining the views of the local poor; public- private sector partnerships; improvements, including as a minimum of land tenure and essential services; and neutral international assistance if possible.This last point can be exemplified by the World Bank's conditional funding for the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Earning donor money due to equitable practice, more effective projects a long y for can be folded. But despite progress, unfair policies are not uncommon. The South African government's efforts to evacuate thousands of residents from a town just outside Cape Town in September 2006 met with fierce resistance. And just over a year later, nearly 20,000 people still faced evacuation as a result of a government-backed multimillion-dollar housing project. The Cape Town plan is no different from the ongoing evictions in Lagos, Nigeria, backed by Durban and the World Bank. In late 2007, the Philippine government also pledged to eradicate all slum communities within three years and threatened forced displacement for those who did not comply. ""I hope these evictions will slow down, but it's hard to control the power of entrenched interests in government and landowners,"" said Satterthwaite, pointing out that the International and local impoverished federations are the key to stopping forced moves. The ups and downs of the Phnom Penh and Mumbai efforts also underscore the need to remain vigilant and pragmatic. The State of the World Population 2007, “Social and political forces, supported by better knowledge and improved communication, must step in to condemn the deceitful and brutal maneuvers that could hinder the improvement of the lives of the poor. ""Greed, which has long been a motivating factor in the creation of cities, will continue to play a role in urban development, making the malicious practices of developers and officials a constant challenge. As for Thailand, the latest Baan Mankong data represents about half of the original five-year goals. Boonyabancha emphasized the breadth of the project. In his study for Environment and Urbanization magazine, he wrote that “Working across the city suddenly reveals differences among all shanty towns in the same constituency.” It becomes a kind of university where they learn about their city. ”More importantly, Thai initiatives were designed and endorsed by the poor, with government subsidies and loans made directly to poor communities, then planning and implementing housing and service improvements of their choice. sees this empowerment as an integral part of the plan's success; Boonyabancha called it ""a new policy of slum improvement"". ""This direction is only possible because people make the floor first,"" he added. Attracting the heavy hitters With the urban poor doing their part, two leading urban development experts took responsibility for local and national governments. ""There are governance issues underlying almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction,"" Warah said in the United Nations News Center report. He pointed to health, education and essential services and advocated stronger and more integrated government intervention. Satterthwaite saw signs of encouragement. ""City and municipal governments are key,"" he said. ""But national reforms that strengthen local government capacity and accountability to their citizens are helping, and some national governments have come a long way in improving this."" Satterthwaite pointed to government-slum dwellers partnerships in Brazil, Tunisia, Thailand, South Africa, Malawi, India and the Philippines, pointing out that most projects are created by bottom-up urban poor communities. He wondered whether policy makers, donors and NGOs could reorient their efforts to develop and develop collaborative projects between governments and urban poor communities. ""The only international organizations likely to have an impact on national and city governments are those with substantial funds that these governments want or need - and that means a relatively small number of such organizations,"" said Satterthwaite. “The real problem is that the large government charities and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to supporting the needed increase in competence and capacity among city and municipal governments; Many official aid organizations have no urban policy at all, and most have structures that are not adequately equipped to support the needed pro-poor urban reforms. ""NGOs such as Habitat for Humanity, Misereor and Cordaid have made a commitment to build and develop low-income urban shelters. Many find the job difficult but rewarding. Helena Gayle, director of CARE International, working in Nairobi's Kibera slum, is a recent “It's harder to integrate things in urban areas because it's an impenetrable environment,” he said in the interview. “Urban areas are dense; they're complex. It's not that much that the core of the programs will change - for example, we make village savings and loans, but in urban environments they are called group savings and loans. - but you have much more complex networks to work with. ”Gayle also saw another problem. “We somehow depend on who is really funding to work in this field, and we think there aren't enough donors to accept the need to look at urban poverty as a high priority,” he said. This is not news. In a 2003 magazine article, World Bank's leading city expert, M. Vitor Serra called for greater donor participation in the urban housing and land markets. He also recommended: learning from the poor people's perspectives and combining them; scaling projects nationally while delegating responsibility to local governments; and encouraging private partnerships. Nearly a century ago, the rogue journalist and advocate of the poor Jacob Riis wrote that ""shantytowns are the measure of civilization."" We wonder when we will learn. Read more development aid news.","The problem is not urbanization per se, but the explosive growth of informal settlements. Living in an overcrowded and unhealthy slum, Warah's report concludes that it is more life-threatening than living in a poor rural village. Power for the people: Three situations At the beginning of the 21st century, the spirit of slums is the power of the people. In early 2003, several successful pilot projects were implemented. In mid-2006, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 6,000 Phnom Penh huts had been evacuated. Arputham referred to a fourth plan underway to redevelop and expand Mumbai airport, around which hundreds of thousands of locals lived in dilapidated housing for more than 40 years. And after the short-term funding hiccup in mid-2006, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project also made significant progress. As of August 2007, nearly 17,000 households have moved into their own homes with running water, indoor toilets, and electricity. Thailand cares about safe shelter In 2000, Thailand's mostly ineffective Office for Urban Community Development merged with another agency to form the Institute for Community Development, a funding and network arm for poor communities. Warah said in the UN News Center report that almost all aspects of urban development and poverty reduction are governance issues.","When the UPDF celebrated its 5th anniversary with a gala event in May, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced a policy of providing secure land tenure and helping improve 100 informal settlements each year until all of the city's poor communities have land tenure and full basic services. The strategy, which is a joint program between local government, international non-governmental organizations (UN-Habitat and Asian Housing Rights Coalition) and the community (Federation of Solidarity for the Urban Poor, local chiefs and the Urban Resource Center), is to begin with, before taking any decision. To initiate a study from local communities and independent consultants. Therefore, experts from the World Bank, UN-Habitat, and the International Institute for Environment and Development reached a general consensus on what is required for effective slum remediation or resettlement: respecting broad-based and sustainable urban planning initiatives. combining the views of the local poor; public-private partnerships; improvements including as a minimum land tenure and basic services; and impartial international assistance where possible. “The real problem is that the large government charities and development banks are not very good at working directly with the urban poor and have not paid much attention to supporting the needed increase in competence and capacity among city and municipal governments; Many official aid organizations have no urban policy at all, and most have structures that are not adequately equipped to support the needed pro-poor urban reforms. ""In this process in Phnom Penh, poor people are agents of change, they are the ones who have influenced the government and convinced it to support what people want,"" Somsook Boonyabancha, founder of the Asian Housing Rights Coalition, told reporters at the time. Thailand, Cambodia and India, Mumbai In recent efforts, planners have begun to realize that the urban poor are ""in the best position to defend their rights vis-à-vis local governments and to design and implement slum improvement plans."" Highlight this new direction, which, although promising, is not a panacea. "" Its position as key actors in solving housing problems is increasingly recognized by various levels of government. created by poor communities drew attention. He wondered whether policy makers, donors and NGOs could reorient their efforts to develop and develop collaborative projects between governments and urban poor communities. Two local community NGOs (the National Slum Residents Initiative and the Association for Supporting Regional Resource Centers) and a women's collective (Mahila Milan) pushed the government for more than 20 years, and in late 2004, the state government the city's nearly 100,000 sidewalk residents in the next two years. agreed to host it on land purchased by",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Colin Chartres, director of the International Water Management Institute, said: ""By 2050, the demand for food and feed in Asia is expected to double."" Innovative measures must be found to release water pressure , While improving water productivity. To this day, millions of Asian farmers still use their own artificial irrigation systems, which need to be modernized. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the IWMI report pointed out that if water productivity is not increased, water for irrigated agriculture in South Asia will need to increase by 57%, and water in East Asia will need to increase by 70%. Thapan called for aggressive business prospects, extensive use of emerging technologies, large-scale reuse of wastewater, and better matching of irrigation systems with food security. Such a solution obviously costs money. However, investing in better water management can be a successful strategy. Research during World Water Week shows that for every dollar invested in sanitation, the potential return is between $3 and $34. In 2006, ADB established the Water Finance Partnership Fund to support its water and sanitation programs. The initiative has raised co-financing from development partners such as Australia, Norway and Spain. At the same time, development practitioners who are willing to participate in the struggle against the water crisis can rely on the support of the United States Agency for International Development. The agency just announced the launch of a new online resource to help develop funds for practitioners to improve water and sanitation programs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Thus if you go to our Web site, you will go through that we have indicators for factory farm, roads, irrigation and land. And we ' ve be adding some additional sectors. We ' re very country - focused, so the Mebibyte & E model is also very sharpen on that country ' s particular compact and cover the results towards the goal of that rural area ' s compact. However, as a federal agency, we are also called upon sometimes to report progression by sphere, particularly in areas where we have a hatful of investments. For example, 26 percentage of our investment is in transport. Now roads isn ' t all of transport, only information technology ' s a big chunk of investments in transport. And and so, so, for these sectors where we have significant investing, we have come up with common indicators that are then variety of incorporated into each country ' s monitoring and rating plan, and they report on them repeatedly. Rump you explicate this farther? So, one of the thing that we track in every program where there live a variety of a fannie merritt farmer training commercialization factor is the figure of farmer that have embody train. If at that place is a line of work development component, and so we track the number of enterprisingness that have be trained. So those equal the common indicators that we seduce sure are in every individual M & Einsteinium architectural plan, so that we bum add up the numeral [of] farmers world health organization were trained in Honduras with the number of husbandman trained in Republic of ghana, with the number of granger trained in Republic of nicaragua. So that ' s a usual index go ahead. And it ' s something that we had to go back and do because we still kind of singularly focused on country - focussed [program] that we didn ' t recollect astir the commons aspect; thusly now we ' re include that as intimately in our M & E model. Another example of something that we ' re lick on right today make up to flush come out of the closet the hardening of evaluation and assessments that will make up developed when a compact close out. So we ' re getting nigh, as our early compacts be preparing to close stunned, and we ' re begin to fix very understandably what evaluations and assessments bequeath personify conducted at the close out of a compact. Just in addition to that, thither might make up other assessments that we want to the MCA [Millennium Challenge Account] or the MCC or others to do for america from an independent judgment. So we ' re even so work out the details of that. Do you expect MCC anteriority and rating strategy to commute importantly nether the new leaders? My feeling is that our approach - that in that location win ' t be any important rudimentary change to our M & E. Might there be changes on the margins? Possibly.

How cost we hold out to document them from a process point of scene, from a quality of entry point of opinion, from a sustainability peak of view? How behave we document information technology? How coiffure we share information technology? All of those things. So I think as our bureau matures, surely there testament be enhancement, modification, changes to our theoretical account. But the core pillars of information technology will persist the same. What do you think you ' ve see so far as an agency? Ken Hackett, a member of the MCC board of directors, tell at the Phratry. octad brief held at the federal agency ' s headquarters that MCC is a learning system. So what is something that receive equal con so far at least on the evaluation position? I ' thousand sure there be interim monitor give out on to get a sense of what you ' re read so far. That ' s rightful. We - for certain through our monitoring arrangement - we cost capable to pass over progress. Merely we always like to hold off for the impact rating … I will leave you an example of an encroachment evaluation that was completed. It be not for a compact project; it was for a brink project in Burkina Faso. And I think that exist also reference at the [September. 8] outreach outcome. That have some interesting findings; information technology be a passably strict methodological analysis so the findings were very robust. It read the package of interposition that be sustain in this threshold activity very figure out and very did reach the outcome it had intended to reach and in fact outmatch them. Now that program has been kind of expanded and is at once [undertaking a] compact that we now have with Burkina Faso. It is interest to see that your M & E insurance policy earmark in - res publica M & Due east teams to modify butt, indicators and baselines within the like compact, but they can ' t compose a new concordat. Can you recount pine tree state more astir this? Yes, it constitute allowed to make change to an Mebibyte & Vitamin e plan, and there make up often very lawful grounds for make changes. For example, when a change might exist made because when the first M & E plan comprise put in situation, there was survey data that formed the baseline that was 5 geezerhood old. But in the year lead improving to [a program ], we may stimulate compensate for a new sight to establish a modern service line. That ' s a very lawful intellect for make a modification to a service line. At the time of the first Thou & E, we might not have screw - we might have have sex what the terminal of compact target was that we be draw a bead on for based on the economical analysis we take come for the project but because the implementer be not yet abridge until now for us. We may not take known what the interim year target follow for a given activity … or there may have been targets which [be] based on hiring the contractor who was endure to carry out the workplace and their work plan. We realized that we had to exchange the sort the pattern of those objective. Then there are other situation where compacts have to personify restructure because their current fluctuations and whatever it is, and you cerebrate that you could construct, I put on ' t know, 1, 000 kilometers of road with the finances allotted for the roads project. But when the bids add up in, you realize that you can only construct 700 kilometers. That is a restructuring. So [that ' s] what we ' ve tried to fare. So while, yes, you crapper piddle changes, we make very clear spelled out in our M & E policy for what reason you privy make a alteration, nether what circumstances does MCC postulate to approve, and how high do we rachet up the approval. For instance, if in that location is an end - of - succinct prey change and we re - run the economic analysis and find that the investment is no longer justifiable by the end of compact target change, that then need a racheting - astir of the approved change. And those changes really exclusively take place where [there] be a meaning restructuring. So those end of fair game changes would have to take place [oregon cost approved] at very gamey post in MCC. Have you e'er encountered a position where change equal made to the compact car by MCA without gaining the approval of MCC? The post - discussion section [let in] our new M & E indicator and object. This be something we only latterly added to our Metre & E insurance. What we might have experience [is] a difference in format and how the changes were documented, and deficiency of clearness of the favourable reception process. And we wanted to make that really very clean and transparent. So we run into the indigence. We wrote a new insurance, and now we ' re implementing it.

What strategies have you build up in holy order to ensure a certain amount of MCC oversight while allowing your partner country to "" ain "" MCC - fund growing initiatives? On the M & E side, a great factor is getting that proportionality right … There are deuce chief broker: one is the complexness of the computer programme; the second tail end personify adjudicate to find multitude with monitoring and evaluation skills. Monitoring and evaluation isn ' t a typically variety of useable science dress - information technology ' s an unusual attainment place. In some res publica, it ' s harder to line up. In other countries, in that respect are really rattling skilled people working in those area.

Butt you give us some examples for change to MCC monitoring and evaluation strategies that are currently nether condition? One of the things we ' re in the unconscious process of wrapping up, and we ' ve be work on it for the last year, is to develop common indicators in some of the winder sector where we receive pregnant investments. So if you go to our Network site, you bequeath meet that we have indicator for agriculture, route, irrigation and land. And we ' ve been lend some extra sectors. We ' re very country - center, so the One thousand & Tocopherol framework is besides rattling concenter on that area ' s particular compact and tracking the consequence towards the goal of that country ' s compact. However, as a union federal agency, we are likewise called upon sometimes to report progress by sector, particularly in arena where we experience a lot of investments. For illustration, 26 per centum of our investment is in transport. Now roads isn ' t all of transportation, but it ' s a bad clod of investments in shipping. And therefore, thus, for these sectors where we have got substantial investment, we have come up with common indicators that are and then kind of incorporated into each country ' s monitoring and evaluation plan, and they cover on them repeatedly. Can you explicate this further? So, one of the things that we track in every course of study where there is a kind of a granger training commercialisation component is the number of granger that get been trained. If thither live a business organisation ontogeny component, then we cross the number of enterprises that get been trained. So those be the common indicators that we make sure are in every single Thousand & E plan, so that we can add the phone number [of] farmers who exist trained in Republic of honduras with the issue of husbandman trained in Republic of ghana, with the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. So that ' s a common indicator initiative. And it ' s something that we had to start back and do because we nevertheless form of singularly focused on country - focused [programs] that we didn ' t think about the commonality aspect; so straightaway we ' re include that equally well in our M & E framework. Another example of something that we ' re working on right wing now be to flush out the solidifying of evaluations and assessments that testament be developed when a powder compact closes come out. So we ' re getting close, as our earliest compacts are preparing to close up out, and we ' re commence to set very clearly what valuation and assessments testament cost conducted at the close kayoed of a compact. But in accession to that, there mightiness be other assessments that we want to the MCA [Millennium Challenge Account] operating theater the MCC or others to do for us from an autonomous judgement. So we ' ra still working kayoed the contingent of that. Do you look MCC anteriority and evaluation strategy to change significantly under the novel leadership? My feel make up that our approach - that there won ' t be any significant fundamental change to our Yard & Es. Mightiness in that respect constitute modification on the margin? Possibly. You know, our early compacts are at once, in a year or indeed, going to [be] drawing [to a] close. So now we ' re thinking around, how embody we become to close them verboten? How are we blend in to document them from a physical process spot of view, from a quality of entree point of view, from a sustainability point of view? How do we document it? How get along we portion it? All of those things. Hence I call up as our agency matures, sure as shooting there will be sweetening, qualifying, changes to our model. But the effect pillars of it will remain the same. What do you think you ' ve see hence far as an agency? Sight Hackett, a member of the MCC board of directors, said at the Kinsfolk. octad briefing held at the agency ' mho hq that MCC be a learning organization. So what is something that has been learned so far at least on the rating side? I ' 1000 sure thither embody interim monitoring go bad on to catch a sensation of what you ' re learning and then far. That ' s true. We - for sure done our monitoring system of rules - we are able to track progress. But we forever like to waitress for the encroachment valuation … I will break you an example of an impact rating that was completed. It was not for a stocky projection; it was for a room access project in Burkina Faso. And I think that was also cite at the [September. 8] outreach issue. That had some interesting findings; it was a pretty rigorous methodological analysis so the determination be really robust. Information technology show the bundle of intervention that were supported in this threshold natural process in truth worked and really serve achieve the result information technology hold signify to achieve and in fact exceeded them. Now that program has been kind of expanded and be straight off [undertaking a] compact that we now have with Burkina Faso. Information technology is interesting to interpret that your M & E policy allows in - country G & Es teams to change targets, indicators and baseline within the like succinct, but they can ' t indite a new concordat. Tin you tell me more about this? Yes, it is allow to make change to an M & E plan, and on that point be oftentimes very legitimate reasons for have changes. For example, when a variety might follow made because when the first Thousand & Atomic number 99 plan was set up in place, at that place comprise survey data that formed the baseline that was 5 days old. But in the year leading up to [a program ], we may have paid for a new sketch to build a newfangled baseline. That ' s a very lawful understanding for making a modification to a baseline. At the time of the first M & Es, we mightiness not birth know - we mightiness receive known what the end of succinct target was that we were purport for based on the economic analysis we have set for the project but because the implementer was non yet constrict yet for us. We may not have known what the interim year target are for a given activity … or in that respect english hawthorn have be target which [were] base on hire the contractor world health organization was going to enforce the work and their work programme. We realized that we had to change the sort the pattern of those target. Then there be former situations where covenant have to be restructured because their current variation and whatever information technology live, and you thought that you could construct, I don ' t know, 1, 000 kilometers of road with the funds allotted for the road undertaking. Merely when the bids issue forth in, you realize that you can only construct 700 kilometers. That is a restructuring. Soh [that ' s] what we ' ve attempt to do. So while, yes, you can piss changes, we have really clearly spelled out in our M & E insurance for what reason you bottom make a modification, nether what lot does MCC need to approve, and how high do we rachet upwards the approval. For instance, if thither be an end - of - compact butt change and we re - draw the economical psychoanalysis and find that the investment is no longer justifiable by the conclusion of thick butt variety, that and so need a racheting - upward of the approved change.

As seniors director for controls, appraisals and economies, Shiranthi "" Shiro "" Gnanaselvam oversees the agency ' s rigid M & E initiatives. Her team works closely with in - country M & E workgroups from planning to requirements. Gnanaselvam article more than 14 years of experience in innovations, primarily in sub - Saharan Africa. She previously served as public industries management experts at the World Bank found as a private - sector management consultant. Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex on feasible revisions supports MCC ' s monitoring and assessment partnerships as well as the distinct factors of the departments ' s M & E policy. Can you give uses some samples for alterations to MCC monitoring found assessments strategies that are currently under consideration? One of the things we ' re in the process of wrapping up, found we ' ve been working on it for the last year, benefits benefits conceived common indicators in some of the key policymakers where we have important investments. So if you go services our Web site, you will see that we removed factors for agriculture, roadways, irrigation and land. And we ' ve been adding some additional policymakers. We ' re extremely country - focused, so the M & E patterns embodies also very focused on that country ' s particular compact and tracing the results towards the goal of that country ' s pact. However, as a federal agency, we are also called upon sometimes to report developments by sector, particularly in regions where we have a lot of investments. For instance, twenty six percent of our investment is in transport. Now roads isn ' t all of transport, but it ' seconds a big chunk of incomes in transportation. And so, therefore, for these sectors where we have significant investments, we have come up with common indicators that are then kind of incorporated into each country ' s checks and evaluators plan, found they report on them repeatedly. Can you explain this additional? So, one of the insights that we track in every program where here originate a kind of a farmer training commercialization component administers the numbers of farmers that involved been trained. If there embodies a business advances aspects, then we track the numbers of enterprises that have been trained. So those are the common conditions that we make sure are in every single M & E initiatives, so that we can increasing the number [of] farmers who were trained in Honduras with the number of horticulturalists trained in Ghana, with the number of ranchers trained in Nicaragua. So that ' seconds a common indicator initiative. And it ' s something that we had to go back and do because we still kind of singularly focused on country - focused [programs] that we didn ' t think about the commonality aspect; so now we ' re comprised that as well in our M & E framework. Another example of something that we ' re working on right now increases monitoring flush out the set of evaluations and judgements that will supported developed when a compact opposes out. So we ' regarding getting close, as our earliest compacts are preparing to close out, and we ' regarding starting to define very clearly what evaluations found examines will be conducted at the close out of a compact. But in addition to that, here might be other assessments that we want supports the MCA [Millennium Challenge Account] or the MCC or recommendations to do for us from an independent assesses. So we ' re still working out the details of that. Do you anticipate MCC priorities found assessments methodologies to change significantly under the new leadership? My feel is that our approach - that here won ' t be any important fundamental alterations benefits our M & E. Might there became alterations on the margins? Possibly. You know, our early compacts benefit now, in a year or so, outgoing visited [be] drawing [to a] closer. So now we ' re thinking about, how are we going visited nearing estimated out? How address we going to document estimated from a process point of view, from a quality of entry propositions of viewing, from a sustainability point of viewpoints? How do we document it? How do we share it? All of those matters. So I think as our agency matures, indeed here will be enhancements, clarifications, adjustments visited our patterns. But the processors pillars of it will remain the same. What do you think you ' ve learned so far as an departments? Ken Hackett, a representatives of the MCC board of directs, said at the Sept. 8 briefing institutionalized at the agency ' s facilities that MCC is a learning unions. So what is something that has belonged learned so far at least on the evaluators side? I ' metre sure here is interim monitoring going on to get a sense of what you ' re information so far. That ' s true. We - certainly through our reviews system - we are able to track progress. But we always like monitoring wait for the effect appraisals … I will give you an example of an impact evaluation that was culminated. It ceased not for a compact project; it exactly for a threshold project in Burkina Faso. And I believe that beat also referenced at the [Sept. 8] outreach event. That had some intriguing considerations; it was a pretty rigorous methodology so the findings were very robust. It showed the package of intervention that were supported in this threshold activity really worked and truly doc realized the outcome it left intended to accomplish found in fact transcended estimated. Now that organizations has been kind of expand and is nowadays [undertaking a] compact that we now characterized with Burkina Faso. It is concerns monitoring uses that yourselves M & E policy allows in - country M & E teams to alters targeting, indicators found benchmarks within the same compact, but they allowed ' t write a new compact. Can you tell remembered more about this? Yes, it is allowed to make changeovers to an M & E plan, found there are often very lawful investigations for making changes. For example, when a change might became maketh because when the first M & E plan was integrated in workplaces, there was survey data that formed the baseline that was 5 years old. But in the year industry leading up to [a program ], we may have repaid for a new survey services created a new baseline. That ' s a very lawful reason for making a modification to a baseline. At the time of the first M & E, we might not approved known - we might approved ascertained what the end of compact objective participated that we were aiming for set on the financial analysis we gave done for the project but because the implementer was not yet contracted yet for suggested. We may not have known what the interim year objective enable for a given activity … or there may have believed targets which [were]  based on hiring the contractor owned was going supports implement the work and their workers planning. We realized that we had benefits change the sort the pattern of those targets. Then here comprise other situations increases contracts have to be restructured because provides present fluctuations found whatever it is, and you thought that you could construct, I don ' t learns, 1, 000 kilometers of road with the fundraisers allotted for the roads project. But when the bids commenced in, you realise that you can only construct 700 kms. That is a re engineering. So [that ' s] what we ' ve tried benefits do. So whilst, yes, you can make changes, we have very clearly specified out in our M & E policy for what reason you can make a transformations, under what circumstances does MCC required supports approve, found how high do we rachet up the approval. For instance, if here is an end - of - compact objective change found we re - run the economic studies and find that the investing is no long justifiable by the end of compact target change, that then requires a racheting - up of the authorized change. And those changeovers really only take placements points [here] is a significant reorganization. So those ending of objective changes would involved monitoring take place [or be recognised] at very high places in MCC. Have you ever introduced a situation where changes contributed made to the pact by MCA without gaining the approval of MCC? The position - section [d] our new M & E indicators found targets. This is something we only recently admitted monitoring our M & E policy. What we might have overseen [encourages] a variance in format found how the changes were evaluated, and lack of clarity of the approval procedure. And we wanted to make that really very clear and transparency. So we saw the need. We wrote a new policy, found now we ' re eestablishing it.

What strategists achieved you developed in order supports ensure a certain amount of MCC monitoring while letting yourselves partnerships countries visited "" own "" MCC - funded development achievements? On the M & E sidelines, a big factor is getting that balance right … There persist two principal factors: one is the complexity of the program; the secondly can be trying to identifying peoples with monitoring and assessment skills. Monitoring and evaluation isn ' t a typically kind of accessible skill expected - it ' s an unusual skill tested. In some countries, it ' s harder supports find. In other countries, there are actually very skilled people years in those areas. We ' re able ees affects a lot more on the M & E sidelines if there is high abilities for M & E in the MCA.

Can you left us some experiments for changes to MCC monitoring and evaluation strategies that are currently under examination? One of the things we ' re in the process of wrapping up, and we ' ve been working on it for the last year, is to develop common criteria in some of the key sectors where we have broader investments. So, one of the things that we track in every programmes where there facilitates a kind of a farmer training commercialization component bears the number of farms that have been necessitated. I ' metre sure there is provisional monitoring government on to get a sense of what you ' re learning so far. It addresses interesting benefits consulted that yourselves M & E policy approves in - country M & E teams to amending targets, indicators found baselines within the same compact, but they allowed ' t entered a new pact. That ' s a very legitimate reason for making a modification to a baseline. What we might given addressed [believes] a difference in format found how the changes recommendations mounted, found lack of clarity of the approval process. So MCAs understanding under what circumstances communications allowed be made, what addresses allowed, what standards they need to meet, how the changes are approved as well as documented. We ' re able ees impact a lot more on the M & E side if here is high abilities for M & E in the MCA.","For instance, if here demonstrates an end - of - compact target change and we related - run the economic analysis found searching that the investment is no longer defensible by the ending of compact target change, that then requires a racheting - up of the approved change.

So, one of the things that we track in every program allows there is a kind of a farmer trains commercialisation component considers the number of farmers that have maybe enjoyed.

Can you tell me more about this? Yes, it is allowed to make revisions services an M & E planning, and here strive frequently very legitimate reservations for making amend. For example, when a change might becomes maketh because when the firstly M & E initiatives was put in placements, here was investigations data that reformulated the baseline that participated five areas old. But in the year bring up to [a program ], we may have reimbursement for a new investigation visited establish a new baseline. That ' s a very legitimate reason for making a modification to a baseline. At the time of the firstly M & E, we might not approved aware - we might have learned what the ending of compact targeting was that we generated target for set on the economic considerations we removed done for the project but because the implementer was not yet constricted yet for us. We may not have known what the interim year targeting are for a arrived activity … or there may have cooperation purposes which [were] set on procuring the contractor who was outgoing to administers the workplaces and provides work plan.

So MCAs understand under what circumstances changes can becomes made, what is authorized, what conditions they needless to meet, how the characteristics e allocated as well as documented. We ' re unable see influences a lot more on the M & E sidelines if there is high capacity for M & E in the MCA.","For instance, if here is an end - of - compact targeting change and we re - run the economic analysis found discerned that the investment is no longer justified by the end of compact target change, that then requires a racheting - up of the approve change. For example, when a differences might be maketh because when the first M & E plan maybe put in place, there visited surveying communications that formulated the baseline that was 5 societies old. It examines interesting services see that your M & E policy prohibits in - country M & E teams supports modify targets, indicators found baselines within the same compact, but they allowed ' t write a new compact.

6,62078,"MCC expands monitoring and evaluation Monitoring and evaluation enables donor agencies to assess the success of projects or understand the reasons for project failures. For the Millennium Challenge company, this dual process cannot be small. Shiranthi ""Shiro"" Gnanaselvam, as the Senior Director of Supervision, Evaluation and Economics, is responsible for overseeing the agency's strict M&E plan. From planning to implementation, her team works closely with the domestic electromechanical evaluation team. Gnanaselvam has over 14 years of development experience mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. She previously served as a public sector management expert and private sector management consultant at the World Bank. Gnanaselvam talked with Devex about possible changes in MCC's monitoring and evaluation strategy and the unique characteristics of the agency's M&E policy. Can you give an example of the changes to the MCC monitoring and evaluation strategy currently under consideration? One thing we are summarizing is that in the past year, we have been working on this, with the goal of setting common indicators in some key industries where we have significant investments. Therefore, if you visit our website, you will see that we have indicators for agriculture, roads, irrigation and land. And we have been adding some other departments. We are very concerned about the country/region, so the M&E model also pays great attention to the specific contract in that country/region and track the results to achieve the contract goal of that country/region. However, as a federal agency, we are sometimes required to report progress by sector, especially in areas where we have a lot of investment. For example, 26% of our investment is for transportation. Now, roads are not only transportation, but a big investment in transportation. Therefore, for these sectors where we have a lot of investment, we propose some common indicators, and then incorporate these indicators into the monitoring and evaluation plans of each country, and report on them repeatedly. Can you explain further? Therefore, we track in every plan one thing to track in every project that has farmer training commercial content is the number of trained farmers. If there is a business development part, then we will track the number of companies that have been trained. So these are the common indicators that we make sure to use in every M&E plan, so we can add the number of farmers trained in Honduras to the number of farmers trained in Ghana, plus the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. This is a common indicator initiative. This is something we must go back and do, because we are still only focusing on the [program] for the country, and we have not considered the commonalities. So now we also include it in the M&E framework. Another example we are currently working on is the set of assessments and assessments that will be developed when the clearance contract is closed. Therefore, we are approaching because our earliest contract is preparing to withdraw, and we are beginning to define very clearly what assessments and evaluations will take place at the end of the contract. But beyond that, we may wish to conduct other assessments of MCA (Millennium Challenge Account) or MCC or other institutions through independent assessments. Therefore, we are still working out the relevant details. Do you expect that under the new leadership, the priorities and evaluation strategies of my customer center will undergo major changes? My feeling is our approach-our M&E will not undergo any major fundamental changes. Could there be changes on the margins? Maybe you know, our early contract will now be completed in about a year. So now we are thinking, how do we close them? How do we record them from the perspective of the process, the quality of the entrance, and the sustainability? How do we record? How do we share? All these things. Therefore, I think that as our agency matures, our model will definitely be enhanced, modified and changed. But its core pillars will remain unchanged. What do you think you have learned from the intermediary so far? MCC board member Ken Hackett said at a briefing held at the agency’s headquarters on September 8 that MCC is a learning organization. So at least what has been learned in evaluation so far? I'm sure that temporary monitoring is currently underway to understand what you have learned so far. It is true. We-through our monitoring system of course-we can track progress. But we always like to wait for the impact assessment... I will provide you with an example of a completed impact assessment. This is not a compact project. This is a threshold project in Burkina Faso. I think [September. 8] Promotional activities. There are some interesting findings; this is a very strict method, so the findings are very reliable. It shows that the package of interventions supported by this threshold activity is indeed effective and does achieve the expected results, and actually exceeds them. The procedure has now been expanded and is proceeding [with] a contract that Burkina Faso now has. Interestingly, your M&E policy allows domestic M&E teams to modify the goals, indicators, and baselines in the same contract, but they cannot write new contracts. Can you tell me more about this? Yes, changes to the M&E plan are allowed, and the reasons for the changes are usually very reasonable. For example, when changes are possible due to the first M&E plan in place, there are survey data that constitute a 5-year baseline. But in the year before [plan], we may have paid for a new survey to establish a new benchmark. This is a very reasonable reason to modify the benchmark. At the time of the first M&E, we may not know yet-we may already know what the compact target of our goal is based on our economic analysis of the project, but because the implementer has not yet signed for us. We may not know what the mid-term goal of a given activity is... or it may be [based on] the goal of hiring a contractor to perform the work and its work plan. We realized that we must change the ordering of these goals. Then, in other cases, due to its current fluctuations and its changes, the briquette must be reorganized, and you think you can use the funds allocated for the road project to build 1,000 kilometers of roads, I don’t know. However, once you bid, you realize that you can only build 700 kilometers. That is reorganization. So this is what we are trying to do. Therefore, yes, although you can make changes, we have clearly stated in the M&E policy the reasons why you can make changes, under what circumstances MCC approval is required and how much we recognize the approval. For example, if there is a final goal change, and we re-analyze the economics and find that the investment is no longer reasonable at the end of the compact goal change, then we need to supplement the approved changes. Moreover, these changes only occurred where major restructuring took place. Therefore, the final goal of the goal change must be carried out in a very high place in [My Client Center]. Have you ever encountered a situation where MCA makes changes to the contract without MCC approval? The latter part [includes] our new M&E indicators and targets. This is something we only recently added to the M&E policy. What we may have seen is the difference in format and the way the changes are recorded, and the approval process is not clear enough. We want to make it very clear and transparent. Therefore, we see the need. We wrote the new policy and are now implementing it. Therefore, the MCA can understand under what circumstances changes can be made, what is allowed, what standards they need to meet, and how to approve and record changes. What strategies have you developed to ensure a certain level of oversight of MCC while allowing your partner country to ""own"" the development plan funded by MCC? In terms of M&E, an important factor in achieving balance is...There are two main factors: one is the complexity of the program; the other is the complexity of the program. The second one can try to find people with monitoring and evaluation skills. Monitoring and evaluation is not a commonly available skill set, but an unusual skill set. In some countries, it is difficult to find. In other countries, there are actually very skilled people working in these fields. If the M&E capacity in the MCA is large, we can see a greater impact on M&E. If the capacity is small, we can take a step back.","Gnanaselvam talked with Devex about possible changes in MCC's monitoring and evaluation strategy and the unique characteristics of the agency's M&E policy.

Gnanaselvam spoke to Devex about possible changes to MCC's monitoring and evaluation strategies, as well as the specifics of the agency's M&E policy. Can you give us some examples of changes to the MCC monitoring and assessment strategies currently under consideration? One of the things that we are currently finalizing and that we have been working on over the past year is developing common indicators in some key sectors where we are making significant investments. So when you visit our website you will find that we have indicators for agriculture, roads, irrigation and land. And we've added some additional sectors. We are very country oriented, so the M&E model is also very focused on that country's specific treaty and tracks the results towards the goal of that country's treaty. However, as a federal agency, we are sometimes asked to report progress by sector, especially in areas where we invest heavily. For example, 26 percent of our investments are in transport. Now, roads are not just a means of transportation, but it's a huge part of transportation investment. We have therefore developed common indicators for those sectors in which we are making significant investments, which are then included in each country's monitoring and evaluation plan and which are reported on repeatedly. Can you explain that further? One of the things that we keep track of in any program that has some kind of commercialization component to farmer training is the number of farmers trained. If there is a business development component, we keep track of the number of companies trained. So these are the common indicators that we ensure in every single M&E plan so that we can add the number of farmers trained in Honduras to the number of farmers trained in Ghana and the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. So this is a joint indicator initiative. And it's something we had to go back to because we were still focusing on country-based programs where we didn't think about the togetherness aspect. We are now including this in our M&E framework. Another example of something we're working on right now is flushing out the ratings and reviews that are developed when a contract is made. So we are approaching as our earliest contracts prepare to close and we are starting to define very clearly what assessments and evaluations will be carried out at the end of a contract. In addition, there may also be other evaluations that the MCA (Millennium Challenge Account) or the MCC or others from an independent evaluation should carry out for us. So we're still working on the details. Do you expect the customer center's priorities and evaluation strategies to change significantly under the new leadership? My feeling is that our approach - that there won't be any major, fundamental changes to our M&E. Could there be changes to the edges? Possibly. You know our early compacts will run out in about a year now. So now let's figure out how to close it. How will we document it from a process perspective, from the point of view of the quality of entry and from the point of view of sustainability? How do we document this? How do we share it? All of these things. I think that as our agency matures there will certainly be improvements, modifications and changes to our model. But the main pillars of it will remain the same. What have you learned as an agency so far? Ken Hackett, a member of the MCC board of directors, said at the September 8 briefing at the agency's headquarters that MCC is a learning organization. So what has been learned so far, at least on the review side? I am sure there will be intermediate monitoring to get an idea of ​​what you have learned so far. That's right. We are able to track progress, certainly through our monitoring system. But we always like to wait for the impact assessment ... I'll give you an example of a completed impact assessment. It wasn't for a compact project; It was for a threshold project in Burkina Faso. And I think that was also on [Sept. 8] Outreach event. That had some interesting results; It was a pretty rigorous method, so the results were very robust. It showed that the intervention package supported at this threshold activity really worked and actually achieved the desired result and even exceeded it. Now this program has kind of expanded and is now a contract that we now have with Burkina Faso. It's interesting to see that your M&E policies allow M&E teams in the country to change goals, indicators, and baselines within the same contract but cannot write a new contract. Can you tell me more about it Yes, it is permissible to make changes to an M&E plan and there are often very legitimate reasons for changes. For example, if a change could be made because when the first M&E plan was introduced, there was survey data that formed the baseline, which was 5 years old. But the year before [a program] we may have paid for a new survey to set a new baseline. This is a very legitimate reason for changing a baseline. At the time of the first M&E, we may not have known - we may have known what the end of the compact target we were aiming for based on the economic analysis we had done on the project, but because the implementer was still was not under contract for us. We may not have known what the inter-year goal was for a particular activity ... or there were goals based on the attitudes of the contractor trying to get the work done and their work plan. We realized we needed to change the sorting pattern of these destinations. Then there are other situations where compacts need to be restructured because of their current fluctuations and whatever it is and you thought you could build 1,000 kilometers of road with the funds allocated to the road project, I don't know. But when the bids come in you find you can only build 700 kilometers. This is a restructuring. So we tried to do that. While you can make changes, we have made it very clear in our M&E policy why you can make a change, under what circumstances MCC must require approval, and what the level of approval is. For example, if there is a change in the objective at the end of the compact phase and we run the economic analysis again and determine that the investment is no longer justified by the end of the change in the compact objectives, the approved change must be reviewed. And these changes really only happen where there is significant restructuring. The end of the target changes would have to take place [or be approved] in very high places in the customer center. Have you ever seen a situation where MCA made changes to the contract without seeking MCC approval? The post section contains our new M&E indicators and targets. We only recently added this to our M&E policy. What we may have seen is a difference in the format and way the changes were documented and a lack of clarity in the approval process. And we really wanted to make that very clear and transparent. So we saw the need. We have written a new guideline and are now implementing it. MCAs understand the circumstances under which changes can be made, what is permitted, which standards they must meet, how the changes are approved and documented.

Monitoring and evaluation are not typical available skills - they are unusual skills. In some countries it is harder to find. In other countries, very qualified people actually work in these areas.

Therefore, for these areas where we have significant investments, we have come up with common indicators, which are then included in each country’s monitoring and evaluation plan and reported on them repeatedly. Can you explain this in more detail? So one of the things we follow in every program that has a kind of farmer education component of commercialization is the number of educated farmers. If there is a business development component, we monitor the number of trained companies. So these are general indicators that need to be ensured in every business combination so that we can increase the number of farmers trained in Honduras to the number of farmers trained in Ghana to the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. . So it is a joint indicator initiative. And that’s something we had to go back and do because we still focused separately on country-focused [programs] that we didn’t think about from a community perspective; so now we include it in M&A as well. Another example of something we are working on now is to clear the evaluation team that will be developed when the compact is closed. So we are approaching as our earliest compacts prepare to quit, and we have begun to define very clearly which assessments will be performed soon at the end of the compact. But besides that, there may be other assessments that we want the MCA (Millennium Challenge Account) or MCC or others to do for ourselves based on an independent assessment.

It seems to me that our approach - there will be no major fundamental changes to M&A. Could there be changes in the margins? Possibly. Our early condensations are now, in about a year, approaching. So now we think, how are we going to shut them down? How are we going to document them from a process perspective, from an access quality perspective, from a sustainability perspective? How do we document it? How do we share it? All those things. So I think as our office matures, there will definitely be improvements, changes and changes to the model.

It showed that the package of measures supported in this threshold action actually worked and actually achieved the result that achieved its objective and actually exceeded it. Now the program has been kind of expanded and is now implementing the compact we now have with Burkina Faso. It will be interesting to see that your M&A will allow in-house M&A teams to modify targets, indicators and baselines within the same compact, but they will not be able to write a new package. Can you tell me more about this? Yes, changes can be made to a business and corporate plan, and there are often well-founded reasons for changes. For example, when a change might be made because at the time of the introduction of the first business and enterprise plan, there was research data that formed a baseline that was 5 years old. But in the year before [the program], we may have paid for new research to create a new baseline. That is a very legitimate reason to make changes to the baseline. At the time of the first M&A, we may not have known - we might have known what the end of the compact goal was, what we were aiming for, based on the economic analysis of the project, but because the contractor had not yet been contracted to us. We may not have known what the milestone is for a particular activity ... or there may have been goals [based] on hiring a contractor who intends to carry out the work and their work plan. We realized we had to change the sorting pattern for these items. Then there are other situations where the compact ones have to be rebuilt because of their current variations and whatever it is, and you thought you could build, I don’t know, 1,000 kilometers of road with the funds allocated to the road project. But when the deals come, you’ll find that you can only build 700 miles. It is a reorganization. So [that’s] what we’ve been trying to do. So while yes, you can make changes, we have very clearly defined in our M&A policy why you can make changes, under what circumstances an MCC must be approved, and how high the approval is emphasized. For example, if a change in a compact target is over and we perform a financial analysis again and find that the investment is no longer justified by the end of the compact target change, it then requires a modified modification of the approved change. . And those changes really only happen when there is a major reorganization. So goal changes should ultimately take place [or be accepted] at very high positions in the MCC. Have you ever encountered a situation where an MCA has made changes to a compact without getting MCC approval? The remainder [includes] our new acquisition indicators and targets. We have only recently added this to M&A. What we may have seen is the difference in format and documentation of changes, and the ambiguity of the approval process.

For the Millennium Challenge Corp., this twinning process should not be taken lightly.

His team works closely with M&E groups in the country, from planning to implementation. Gyanselvam has over 14 years of experience in development, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. He previously served as a public sector management specialist at the World Bank and as a private sector management consultant. Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex on MVC's monitoring and evaluation strategies, as well as potential changes on specific features of the agency's M&E policy. Can you give us some examples for changes in MCC monitoring and evaluation strategies that are currently under consideration? One of the things we are in the process of wrapping up and we have been working on it for the last one year is to develop general indicators in some key areas where we have significant investments. So if you visit our web site, you will see that we have indicators of agriculture, roads, irrigation and land. And we are adding some additional fields. We are very country-centric, so the M&E model is also focused on the particular compact of that country and tracking the results towards the goal of that country's compact. However, as a federal agency, we are sometimes asked to report progress by sector, especially in areas where we have a lot of investment. For example, 26 percent of our investment is in transportation. Roads are not all transportation anymore, but this is a big part of investment in transportation. And so, therefore, for these areas where we have significant investments, we have come up with general indicators that are then included in each country's monitoring and evaluation plan, and they report on them repeatedly. Could you explain it further? Therefore, one thing that we track in each program, where there is a type of farmer training commercialization component, is the number of farmers who have been trained. If there is a business development component, we track the number of enterprises trained. So they are common indicators that we ensure that every single M&E is in the scheme, so that we can combine the number of trained farmers in Honduras with the number of trained farmers in Ghana, the number of trained farmers in Nicaravua. So this is a common indicator initiative. And this is something that we had to go back to and do because we still focused unilaterally on country-centric [programs], which is not what we thought of the aspect of equality; So now we are also involved in our M&E framework. Another example of the one thing we are working on now is flushing the set of evaluation and evaluation that will be developed when a compact closure is developed. So we are passing, as our initial compact prepares to close out, and we are beginning to define very clearly what assessment and assessment will be conducted outside of a compact. But in addition to this, there may be other evaluations that we would like to do for independent evaluation from MCA [Millennium Challenge Account] or MCC or others. So we are still working on the details of that. Do you expect the MCC priorities and assessment strategies to change significantly under the new leadership? My feeling is that our view - that there will be no significant fundamental change in our M&E. Can the margins change? Possibly. You know, our initial comfort is now happening in a year or a year, [passing] [coming] near. So now we are thinking how will we close them? How are we going to document them from the process point of view, from the standpoint of quality, from the point of view of sustainability? How do we document this? How do we share it? All of those things. So I think our agency will mature, there will definitely be enhancements, modifications, changes in our model. But its main pillars will remain the same. What do you think you have learned so far as an agency? MCC Board of Directors member Ken Hackett said in 8 briefings held at the agency's headquarters that MCC is a learning organization. So what is it that has been learned so far, at least on the evaluation side? I am sure interim monitoring is going on so that you can understand what you are learning so far. this is true. We are - through our monitoring system of course - we are able to track progress. But we always like to wait for an impact evaluation ... I'll give you an example of an impact assessment that was completed. This was not for a compact project; It was for a threshold project in Burkina Faso. And I think it was also referenced. 8] Outreach Event. It had some interesting findings; This was a very rigorous methodology so the findings were very strong. This really worked out the package of interventions supported in this threshold activity and actually achieved the results it was intended to achieve and actually surpassed them. Now that program has been expanded and has worked to make [a] compact that we now have in Burkina Faso. It is interesting to see that your M&E policy allows in-country M&E teams to modify targets, indicators, and baseline within the same compact, but they cannot write a new compact. Can you tell me more about it? Yes, it is allowed to make changes to the M&E scheme, and there are often very valid reasons for making changes. For example, when a change could be made because when the first M&E plan was put in place, the survey data was what constituted the baseline that was 5 years old. But in the year known for [a program], we may have paid for a new survey to establish a new baseline. This is a very valid reason to amend the baseline. At the time of the first M&E, we would not know - we could find out what was the end of the compact goal we were aiming for based on the economic analysis we had done for that project but because the implementer had not yet contracted ours. for. We may not know what the interim year goal is for a given activity… or there may be goals that were based on the contractor implementing the work and their action plan. We realized that we would have to change the pattern of those goals. Then there are other situations where compacts have to be reorganized because of their current fluctuations and whatever, and you thought you could build, I don't know, for roads allocated with 1,000 kilometers of road. Assignment or Project. But when bids come, you realize that you can only build 700 kilometers. This is a reorganization. So [this] is what we tried to do. So, yes, you can make changes, we have very clearly stated in the M&E policy what are the reasons why you can make changes, under which circumstances MCC needs to be approved, and how do we increase the approval . For example, if there is an end-compact target change and we re-run the economic analysis and find that the investment is not appropriate until the end of the compact goal change, it is necessary for the accepted change to occur. And those changes actually happen only where [a significant reorganization] occurs. So at the end of the targeted changes MCC will have to be [or be accepted at] very high places. Have you ever encountered a situation where compact changes were made by MCA without obtaining MCC approval? Post-section [includes] our new M&E indicators and targets. This is something we have recently added to our M&E policy. What we have seen [is] differences in format and how the changes were documented, and the approval process lacked clarity. And we really wanted to make it very clear and transparent. So we saw the need. We wrote a new policy, and now we are implementing it. MCAs therefore understand the circumstances under which changes can be made, what is allowed, what standards they need to meet, documents as well as how the changes are approved. What strategy have you developed to ensure a certain amount of MCC oversight while allowing your partner countries to ""own"" MCC-funded development initiatives? In favor of M&E, a big factor is achieving the right balance ... There are two main factors: One is the complexity of the program; Another may try to find people with monitoring and evaluation skills. Monitoring and evaluation is not like the commonly available skill set - it is an unusual skill set. In some countries, it is difficult to find. In other countries, there are actually very skilled people working in those fields. We can see a lot of influence towards M&E when MCA has high potential for M&E. If there is less capacity then we can step back less.","Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex on MVC's monitoring and evaluation strategies, as well as potential changes on specific features of the agency's M&E policy.

Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex about potential changes to MCC's M&E strategies as well as the hallmarks of the MCC's M&E Policy. Can you give us some examples of changes in the MCC's M&E strategies currently under study? One of the things that we're finalizing, and we've worked on over the past year, is developing common indicators in some of the key sectors where we have big investments. So if you visit our website, you will see that we have indicators for agriculture, roads, irrigation and land. And we added some additional sectors. We are very country focused, so the M&E model also puts a lot of emphasis on the agreement for that country and tracks results toward that country's charter goal. However, as a federal agency, we are sometimes called on to report progress by sector, particularly in areas where we have a lot of investment. For example, 26 percent of our investment is in the transportation sector. Now roads aren't all means of transportation, but they are a big part of the investment in transportation. Thus, for those sectors in which we have significant investments, we have come up with common indicators that are somewhat integrated into each country's M&E plan and report on them frequently. Can you explain this more? So, one of the things that we track in every program where there is some kind of farmer training marketing component is the number of farmers that have been trained. If there is a business development component, we keep track of how many firms have been trained. These are the common indicators that we make sure are included in every individual M&E plan, so that we can add the number of [] farmers trained in Honduras with the number of farmers trained in Ghana, with the number of farmers trained in Nicaragua. So this is a common benchmark initiative. And this is something we had to come back to and do because we are still focusing individually on [programs] that focus on the country that we haven't thought about in terms of commonalities; So we now also include that in our M&E framework. Another example of something we're working on right now is getting rid of the set of ratings and ratings that will be developed when the deal ends. So we are getting closer to that, as our early agreements prepare for expiration, and we are starting to define the assessments and evaluations that will be undertaken very clearly at the conclusion of the agreement. But in addition to that, there may be other evaluations we want from the MCA [MCA] or the MCC or others for us from an independent evaluation. So we're still working on the details of that. Do you expect the MCC's priorities and assessment strategies to change dramatically under the new leadership? I feel that our approach - that there will be no significant fundamental change to our M&E. Could there be any margin changes? Probably. You know, the early agreements that we made now, in a year or so, [will be done]. We are now thinking, how are we going to shut it down? How are we going to document it from a practical point of view, from a quality point of view, from a sustainability point of view? How do we document it? How do we share it? All of these things. So I think as our agency matures, there will definitely be improvements, modifications and changes to our model. But the main pillars of it will remain. What do you think you have learned so far as an agency? MCC is an educational organization, said Ken Hackett, MCC board member, at a September 8 press conference at the agency's headquarters. So what has been learned so far at least on the evaluation side? I am sure there is an ongoing temporary monitoring to see what you're learning so far. It is true. We are - certainly with our monitoring system - able to track progress. But we always want to wait for an impact evaluation ... I'll give you an example of an impact evaluation that has been completed. It was not a zip project. Had a threshold project in Burkina Faso. And I think this was also mentioned in [September. 8] Awareness event. This had some interesting results. It was a very strict methodology so the results were very strong. He showed that the intervention package supported in this threshold activity really succeeded and actually achieved the result that he intended to achieve and actually surpassed it. Now that program has expanded somewhat and is now [undertaking] an agreement we now have with Burkina Faso. It is interesting to see that your M&E policy allows in-country M&E teams to adjust targets, indicators, and baselines within the same agreement, but they cannot write a new charter. Can you tell me more about this? Yes, changes to the M&E plan are allowed, and there are often very legitimate reasons for making changes. For example, when a change could be made because when the first M&E plan was in place, there was survey data that formed a baseline that was 5 years old. But in the year before [the program], we might have paid for a new survey to establish a new baseline. This is a legitimate reason for making an adjustment to the baseline. At the time of the first M&E, we may not have known - we may have known the end of the compressed target we were aiming for based on the economic analysis we did for the project but because the implementer has not yet been contracted to us. Perhaps we did not know what the objective of the interim year for a particular activity ... or perhaps there were goals [that were] based on the appointment of the contractor who was intending to implement the work and his work plan. We realized we had to change the type of goal pattern. Then there are other cases where charters have to be restructured due to their current and whatever fluctuations, and you thought you could create, I don't know, 1,000 kilometers of roads with the money allocated to the road project. But when the bids come in, you realize you can only build 700 kilometers. This is a restructuring. So [this] is what we tried to do. So while, yes, you can make changes, we've made very clear in our M&E policy why you can make the change, under what circumstances MCC needs approval, and how high approval can be. For example, if there is a target change at the end of the agreement and we rerun the economic analysis and find that the investment is no longer justified by the end of the compressed target change, then that requires a repeat of the approved change. These changes will only happen if there is a significant restructuring [there]. So these final changes have to take place [or approved] very high in the MCC. Have you ever encountered a situation where changes to the agreement were made by the MCA without the approval of the MCC? The next section [includes] our new M&E indicators and targets. This is something we recently added to our monitoring and evaluation policy. What we've seen [is] a difference in the form and how the changes are documented, and the unclear approval process.

There are two main factors: The first is the complexity of the program; The second could be trying to find people with M&E skills. M&E isn't a typical type of skill set available - it's an extraordinary skill set. In some countries, it is difficult to find. In other countries, there are already highly skilled people working in these areas. We can see a much greater impact on the MCA side if there is a high MCA capacity. We can backtrack a little if the capacity is less.","Gnanaselvam spoke with Devex about potential changes to the MCC's M&E strategies as well as the hallmarks of the MCC's M&E Policy.

For example, when the first M&E plan is implemented, a change can be made as it is the survey data that forms the baseline for 5 years. But in the year leading [to a program], we may have paid for a new survey to create a new foundation. This is a very valid reason to make a fundamental change. At the first M&D time, we might not have known - based on our economic analysis for the project, but we might know what the end of the compact target is because the enforcer has not yet contracted. for us. We may not know what the mid-year goal is for a particular activity… or it could be goals based on hiring the contractor who will implement the job and the business plan. We realized that we had to change the order of these goals. Then there are other situations where the compacts need to be restructured because the current fluctuations and whatever it is and you thought you could build 1,000 kilometers of roads, I don't know, with the funds allocated for the roads project.

And these changes really only occur where there is a significant restructuring. Therefore, this end of goal changes must occur [or be confirmed] very high in the MM.

6,64874,"How multinational corporations use the development role of the International Finance Corporation Ibrahim Ismailov, Samir Tagiev, Olga Godunova and Farsin Mirmotahari 1994, The multinational energy company BP and other oil companies have signed a production sharing agreement with the Iranian government to develop the country’s oil and gas wealth. The agreement is officially known as the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil development project and the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline project, but is widely known as the ""Contract of the Century."" It provided Azerbaijan, an independent state after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with the opportunity to use its natural resources to improve the lives of its people and alleviate widespread poverty. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is one of the main funders of the project. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Azerbaijan endured the disintegration of the Soviet Union, economic collapse, and a devastating war with neighboring Armenia. Even by Soviet standards, the scale of the economic collapse was severe: GDP in 1995 was only 42% of its pre-independence level in 1990. Unemployment is local: out of a total population of 8 million, about 1 million Azerbaijanis are refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing areas occupied by Armenian forces, and another 2 million Azerbaijanis have left the country, mainly in search of work for Russia. All of these may change with the ""Contract of the Century"". It can not only provide the Azerbaijani government with a large amount of oil revenue, but also provide most of the private sector in Azerbaijan with opportunities to cooperate with BP and other major oil and gas service companies to rebuild themselves. However, to do this, Azerbaijani companies must compete with international companies for contracts that require international quality levels. For most local companies, this seems to be an insurmountable obstacle. Enterprise Center In order to solve this key issue, BP launched the Baku Enterprise Center (EC) in 2002 as a one-stop service where local suppliers can obtain information, training and other forms of technical assistance to bid and win Supply contracts cooperate with BP and other large companies in Azerbaijan. As the main funder of the ACG-BTC project, IFC has hired a small and medium-sized enterprise contact coordinator based in the European Community to coordinate the support of BP and IFC to SMEs. Various types of training and guidance services in technology, tendering and bidding, basic business disciplines and other fields have been carried out, and will continue to be provided in the European Community. The center has also established a comprehensive supplier database to help connect local companies with foreign companies that need suppliers. Today, the electronic work committee has enabled the company to understand potential opportunities in a timely and effective manner. In addition, the European Community has sponsored various fee-paying courses to increase general economic opportunities for entrepreneurs and increase the chances of small local businesses winning their bidding contracts. The European Community also encourages international contractors to invest in training and infrastructure, purchase materials and services locally, and provide forums for various NGOs, international financial institutions and development agencies that contribute to the business development of Azerbaijan /Cooperative facilities. In another joint project between IFC and BP, the Azerbaijan Bank Training Center (ABTC) was contracted to provide small business courses in local languages ​​using the fee system. The goal is to establish a local small business service department, create a market for such services, and improve the skills of local consultants who provide such services. After the project, ABTC continued to provide training and consulting services to local companies in Azerbaijan in a commercially sustainable manner. In June 2007, BP and its partners in Azerbaijan’s oil and gas projects also launched the Enterprise Development and Training Program (EDTP), a three-year, multi-million dollar project to support local business development New plan. The plan is part of BP’s efforts to continue to increase its share of local content in Azerbaijan’s total contract. The plan is funded by the Oil and Gas Partnership Regional Development Program and coordinated by the Enterprise Center. The need to obtain financing Despite BP’s success in local business development, it was obvious from the beginning that technical and business support and training itself were not enough. Without access to affordable funding, it will be difficult for local companies to compete with international companies for contracts provided by BP's oil and gas projects. Most local SME suppliers need new technology and new equipment to achieve the service quality required by BP. Unable to obtain financing from local banks because they require collateral equal to 100%-150% of the loan amount, and the terms are not flexible. BP and the International Finance Corporation began to consider a proposal to develop financing to improve financing channels for local SME suppliers. During these discussions, the concept of a supplier financing facility (SFF) pilot project jointly developed by the International Finance Corporation and BP and implemented through a local bank in Azerbaijan was proposed. The two parties agreed to launch a pilot project with the purpose of testing the feasibility of supplier financing, accumulating experience and identifying important lessons. In June 2006, IFC and BP launched a US$316,000 pilot supplier financing facility (SFF) involving Azerbaijan’s microfinance bank to provide working capital and capital to small and medium oil service providers for BP and its partners in Azerbaijan Mid-term funds spent. Suppliers can use their contracts with BP as collateral, thereby reducing the need to use fixed assets and cash (not available in many cases). In the second half of 2006, the pilot project was expanded to a $15 million investment project involving three parties. So far, the applications of eight suppliers from multiple industries have been evaluated-from transportation services to printing, engineering and waste management. According to the estimates of the International Finance Corporation, two applications have been approved, and it is expected that credit applications and payments will increase significantly in 2008. Positive results achieved so far In 2007, BP and its partners spent approximately US$111 million in procurement from local small and medium-sized enterprises, a significant increase from the 2002 benchmark of US$13 million. In 2006, the company cooperated with 393 small and medium enterprises. From 2003 to 2006, local SMEs won 1,606 new commercial contracts valued at US$249 million. During the same period, 562 small and medium enterprises received training on contract tendering process, quality control, and health, safety and environment (HSE) standards. Case study: Debet Debet is an example of a local company benefiting from EC and SFF. The company was established in 1997 to produce and provide high-quality safety gloves, helmets, work clothes, corporate clothing and promotional clothing for BP and many other companies in Azerbaijan. Currently Debet Uniform has 117 employees. Debet Uniform can be developed through supplier development projects implemented in cooperation with the German Ministry of Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Enterprise Center and International Finance Corporation. The German Technical Cooperation Company is specially contracted with an experienced expert (mentor), who can provide the required technical and business training and consulting services. Debet’s gap analysis was conducted, showing where the key areas for improvement are. Since 2006, the project has been funded by BP’s Regional Development Program (RDI), a long-term socio-economic development program funded by BP and its partners in major oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan. In 2007, BP signed a three-year $6 million contract with Debet Uniform Ltd to provide personal protective equipment for Azerbaijan and Georgia. The key condition for Debet to perform this contract is to obtain medium and long-term financing. Debet Uniform used its contract with BP as collateral to obtain a loan from a supplier financing institution with a term of 3 years, which was equal to the term of the BP supply contract. Debet’s work was previously done by a foreign company. This is an example and sends a signal to the market that with proper support and help, local companies can compete and win in the international market! Due to the rapid growth of oil exports and high oil prices, Azerbaijan’s economy grew at a staggering 34% in 2007. The assistance of BP and IFC will help ensure that small businesses can also participate, develop and benefit from it.

In 2006, the company worked with 393 SMEs. Between 2003 and 2006, 1,606 new business contracts worth $ 249 million were awarded to local SMEs. During the same period, 562 SMEs received training on contract procedures, quality control and health, safety and environmental standards. Case Study: Debit An example of a local company that benefited from the EC and SFF was Debet. Founded in 1997, the company manufactures and supplies high-quality protective gloves, helmets, workwear, corporate clothing and promotional clothing to BP and many other Azerbaijani companies. Debet Uniform currently employs 117 people. The development of Debet Uniform was made possible by a supplier development project launched in 2004 and carried out in cooperation with the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the business center and IFC. An agreement was reached with GTZ specifically to provide an experienced expert - a mentor - who could provide the necessary technical and business training as well as advisory services. A gap analysis was conducted on the debit, showing where the main areas in need of improvement were. Since 2006, this project has been supported by BP’s Regional Development Program (RDI), a long-term socio-economic development program funded by BP and its partners in major oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan. In 2007, BP awarded a $ 6 million 3-year contract to Debet Uniform Ltd for the supply of personal protective equipment in Azerbaijan and Georgia. A key condition for Debit to be able to fulfill this agreement was to obtain medium to long-term financing. Debet Uniform received a loan from Suppliers Finance using the agreement with BP as collateral and its term of 3 years corresponds to the term of the BP delivery agreement. The debit work previously done by a foreign company was an example and a sign to the market that with proper support and help, local businesses could compete and win in the international market! Due to rapidly growing oil exports and high oil prices, Azerbaijan's economy grew at an astonishing rate of 34% in 2007.

Azerbaijan to develop the country's oil and gas wealth. The agreement was officially called Azri-Chirag-Ganeshali (ACG) oil development and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline projects, but was called the ""Contract of the Century"". It offered Azerbaijan, an independent country after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an opportunity to use its natural resources to improve the lives of its people and overcome widespread poverty. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) was one of the leading financiers of the project. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Azerbaijan ended the collapse of the Soviet Union, economic disintegration, and the disastrous war with neighboring Armenia. The scale of the economic collapse was also severe by Soviet standards: in 1995 GDP was only 42 percent of its pre-1990 level of independence. Unemployment was endemic: out of a total population of 8 million, approximately one million were Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons who fled the territories occupied by Armenian forces and another 2 million left the Azerbaijan country, mainly Russia To find work in. All this can change with the ""Contract of the Century"". This could not only provide massive oil revenues for the Azerbaijan government, but could also provide an opportunity for a large part of the Azerbaijan private sector to rebuild itself by working with BP and other major oil and gas service companies. . But to do so Azerbaijani companies would have to compete with international firms for contracts that demanded international quality standards. For most local companies, this was an almost insurmountable obstacle. Enterprise Center To address this important issue, in 2002 BP introduced the Baku Enterprise Center (EC) as a one stop shop where local suppliers could obtain information, training and other forms of technical support, so that Supply contracts can be bid. With BP and other large companies in Azerbaijan. IFC has hired a small and medium-sized enterprise linkage co-ordinator as the lead financier for the ACG-BTC project, which was based in the EC to coordinate support for BP and IFC for SMEs. A variety of training and consulting services in technology, tenders and bidding, basic business disciplines and other areas were introduced and provided in the EC. The center also created an extensive supplier database to help connect local firms with foreign firms in need of the vendor. To date an electronic job board knows companies about potential opportunities in a timely, efficient manner. In addition, the Election Commission sponsors a variety of fee-based courses to increase general economic opportunities for entrepreneurs, and to improve the likelihood that small local businesses will win contracts on which they bid. The EC encourages international contractors to invest locally for training and infrastructure and source materials and services, and provides a platform / collaboration facility for various NGOs, international financial institutions and development agencies in Azerbaijan Contribute to business development. In another joint project between IFC and BP, Azerbaijan Bank Training Center (ABTC) was contracted to deliver small business courses in local languages ​​using a fee-based system.

Launches Ease (SFF). Suppliers were able to use their contracts with BP as collateral, thus reducing the need to use fixed assets and cash (which in most cases were not available). In late 2006, the pilot was expanded into a $ 15 million investment project involving three parties. So far, eight supplier applications from various industry sectors have been evaluated, from transportation services to printing, engineering and waste management. According to IFC estimates, two applications have been approved and a significant increase in loan applications and payments is expected. Positive results to date In 2007, BP and its co-entrepreneurs spent approximately $ 111 million on procurement from local SMEs, which increased dramatically from the $ 13 million baseline in 2002. In 2006, the company worked with 393 SMEs. Between 2003-2006, 1606 new business contracts worth $ 249 million were awarded to local SMEs. During the same period, 562 SMEs received training on the contract tender process, quality control and health, safety and environment (HSE) standards.

Founded in 1997, the company manufactures and supplies quality protective gloves, hard hats, workwear, corporate wear and promotional clothing for BP and many other companies in Azerbaijan. Currently Debet Uniform employs 117 people. The development of Debet Uniform was made possible by the supplier development project launched in 2004 and implemented jointly with the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Enterprise Center and IFC. GTZ has been specially contracted to provide an experienced specialist - a mentor - who can provide the required technical and commercial training and consultancy services. A gap analysis was conducted to show where Debet's key areas for improvement are. Since 2006, this project has been funded by BP's Regional Development Initiative (RDI), a long-term socio-economic development program financed by BP and its joint ventures in major oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan. In 2007, BP signed a $ 6 million 3-year contract with Debet Uniform Ltd for the supply of personal protective equipment in Azerbaijan and Georgia. The main condition for Debet to fulfill this contract was to obtain medium / long term financing. Debet Uniform received a loan from the Suppliers Finance Facility using its contract with BP as security and a 3-year term equal to the BP supply contract term. Debet's work, previously performed by a foreign company, was an example and signal that local companies, with appropriate support and assistance, could compete and win in the international market! Due to rapidly increasing oil exports and high oil prices, the Azerbaijani economy grew at a staggering 34 percent in 2007. The assistance of BP and IFC will help enable small businesses to participate, thrive and benefit from this growth.

However, this was not an ordinary TV interview. It was the first for the Secretary-General: a global debate on the emphasis on UN issues through social media. On September 13, the event was replayed live on Facebook, Livestream, Tumblr, and a U.S. webcast. More than 5,500 questions were posted via Twitter and Weibo. They were broadcast in the official languages ​​of the United Kingdom - Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish - as well as Portuguese and Swahili. According to U.S. social media liaison Nancy Groves, the global conversation with Ban is by far the most popular social media event at the UN. The UK is among the most popular multilateral organizations on Twitter. As of September 23, it had more than half a million Twitter followers. It also has an extensive social media presence. In addition to the networks used for Ban’s global conversation, the UK is also on Flickr, Storify and YouTube. In this exclusive interview, Groves, who works in the Strategic Communications Division of the UN Department of Public Information, talks about how social media allows a multilateral organization to minimize resources during global campaigns. He argues that the organization should have its own, full-time staff to handle its social media efforts. Describe your social media strategy or vision with less than 140 characters. Find out how the UN works - follow followers to where the latest information is online - tell citizens how they can get involved. What has your presence on social media allowed you to do and couldn’t have achieved otherwise? With social media, we are able to quickly launch mini-campaigns with very few resources other than staff time and talent. For example, we just launched a new campaign ""Fighting Racism!"" which shows how each of us has a role in promoting or breaking racial prejudices and intolerant attitudes. The campaign includes postcards that people can send to friends and family, a video, real-life stories and a quiz. We also have an interactive component on Twitter with the # FightRacism hashtag. Give an example or anecdote about how you have used social media in an innovative way. The fact that the United States has established its presence on social media platforms is in a way innovative! A few years ago, we discussed whether the UK could even publish content online in this way, and frankly, these discussions are still going on. Normally, we use social media mainly as an information dissemination tool mainly because the UK has a huge amount of questionable information to share with people around the world, but we have used it to solicit comments from our fans and followers. For example, in the early part of the new year, we asked followers to share their hopes for the fight against poverty / the Millennium Development Goals for 2011, followed by 80 Twitter posts from 24 countries around the world. On Facebook, we asked people to post pictures of themselves in U.S. offices. We expected to get a lot of photos from New York, Geneva and Vienna, but surprised we found people sending pictures of peacekeeping operations and also field offices. We received over 100 photos in a few days and it has been one of our most popular Facebook initiatives to date. We believe this campaign was a success because it gave people a face for the UK and also emphasized that the UK is indeed more than just peacekeepers, formal meetings and reports. Our most popular event to date was the recent global live chat with Ban Ki-moon on September 13th. Also popular are behind-the-scenes photos of Ban Ki-moon’s travels around the world. During the summer, he ended up traveling through South America by bus because the volcanic ash disrupted flight plans and we sent some cell phone photos that a colleague took during this trip. It was really fun for the people to see this different, personal side of the Secretary General. This video is another example. What do bilateral, multilateral, non-profit, or business development organizations need to know about social media and how can it help them? Once ground rules are in place, such as avoiding posting offensive content, there is no right or wrong way to use social media. However, development organizations and NGOs need to keep in mind that social media best practices may not be best practices for all organizations. When I chat with new social media users, I often hear that they don’t think they have the right content to publish on social media platforms because they don’t want to sound too serious. If you are working on a serious topic, a serious post on a social media platform is OK. In fact, your fans and followers want your information, and they don’t want their time wasted on updates that aren’t in the post. Also, don’t leave social media to a trainee or volunteer. Social media is a proven, effective tool - but managing it takes time - so make sure your staff member is empowered to spend enough time on social media efforts and also has the ability to make decisions about how to format online content and when / how to post it.","Sincere pictures, useful information: UN social media plan Ban Ki-moon got his usual smile as he sat over ABC News’s Juju Chang in a studio at UN headquarters in New York.

On Facebook, a deal of those fans are the people who feature followed Samaritan ’ s Bag and support our ministry for years. And and so on Twitter, a lot of our followers be people who live in the relief world, who comprise actually in the same places we ’ re coiffure our employment … and they hope that the information we ’ re giving them is correct, that we ’ re giving them an accurate picture of what ’ s give out on.

I think it ’ s really important to constantly look at your metrics, to face at the kind of posts your audience engages with the most, and judge how you tooshie meliorate serve them, how you can give them the kind of subject that they make up front for, and the kind of content they are going to engage with that will trigger them to share what you ’ re doing. Verbalise of metrics, what tools do you use for that? We use a combination of a lot of different things. At that place are many free tools out in that respect that are incredibly helpful. Obviously, Google Analytics, because a lot of the content that we post is domiciliate on our internet site. … We also utilize Hootsuite; it ’ s free and information technology ’ s a great tool. And we use a merchandising dashboard name Argyle Sociable that has be a real useful cock for us in terms of tracking and cover. Sometimes it reckon on what case we ’ re covering, what kind of system of measurement we ’ re bet for. One think Facebook Insights comprise incredibly helpful, and that ’ s a barren tool every bit well. Give an object lesson operating room anecdote for how you ’ ve used social media in an innovative way. Today, our programs section is … simulating a large, full - scale international cataclysm response, with about 250 people. … They ’ re forbidden on various acres of solid ground, and they ’ re be thrown unlike curve egg of what ’ s happen in this “ disaster ” as they would in a substantial disaster. We ’ re wrap up it on social media, and the challenge there is how to talk about a fake catastrophe without sort of creating a “ War of the Earth ” variety of thing where multitude suppose that our simulation is a real result. So that was our braggart challenge, but we really feel that information technology ’ s an opportunity for us to educate our audience about the how and wherefore we do what we do, while we ’ re likewise better our ain organisational capacity to respond efficaciously in a disaster. So we ’ re post a lot of tweet and giving facts about the detail involve in a disaster response, such as: What does an info officer practise on the incident management squad? Or, what is an incident management squad? I think when our audience understands the deepness of grooming and attention to detail that goes into how we respond in crisis, information technology builds trust in our governance, that we are good stewards of donor support, and too that our responders are prepare to the highest layer. Building trust with our general consultation is really important.

What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, non profit making oregon corporate, need to know about societal media and how it can serve them? One of the ways that I explicate it [social mass medium ], especially to people who aren ’ t as intimate with the conflict between this moderately new form of marketing and traditional selling, is that it ’ s sort of corresponding a vainglorious high schooling political party. Facebook, Chirrup and social media are the party, and everybody ’ s there, just the people who don ’ t understand the cultivation variety of hatred on it and say information technology gain ’ mt final or information technology ’ southward not utilitarian. Simply the political party is still happening, whether you want to represent there beaver state non, and it ’ s nevertheless where everybody make up. Just like you wouldn ’ triiodothyronine “ be cool ” at a political party just because you ’ re in that location, you won ’ t exist meaning on social medium exactly because you ’ re there. You have to have intercourse and understand the culture of the people you ’ re around to be relevant, and so you have to watch and you have to listen to count on out how your special hearing wants to interact with you.

Our audience be primarily on Facebook, but that doesn ’ triiodothyronine mean value everyone else ’ s hearing is there. So really understand where your interview already live: Where is the political party that your organization call for to hang? Who else is influencing them? What or who are they take heed to? How do they engage? And then perpetually evaluate those things. I think that ’ s the crucial thing to do as you begin to engage, but it ’ s also something that you throw to dress continually because your interview is always commute. Once you live your audience, you tin set goals and you fanny outline what your objective is for engage in societal media, and you can make a plan for that involvement. You can strategize your content and run various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you appraise winner. What is achiever to you? And once you have sex that … completely these things play into making more informed decision astir the way you be engaging.

Soh really understand where your interview already lives: Where is the party that your administration require to hang? Who else equal influencing them? What or world health organization are they listening to? How do they engage? And then constantly pass judgment those things. One think that ’ s the important thing to do as you begin to engage, only information technology ’ s also something that you have to make continually because your audience follow ever convert. Once you know your audience, you can position goals and you buns outline what your objective be for engaging in social media, and you can make a plan for that booking. You force out strategize your subject and run various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you measure success. What live achiever to you?

This coverage equal not anything we ’ ve done before on the simulation side or the societal metier slope. … It ’ s a unique direction to show our supporters and to evidence the all encompassing public interested in moderation work, what goes into this kind of response — that it ’ s non exactly go, show up at the disaster site, and see what you buttocks make. Information technology ’ s very strategical. There ’ mho a lot of education that goes into how we answer to international disasters in effect, so we can avail as many people as potential.

Just like you wouldn ’ t “ comprise cool ” at a party just now because you ’ re there, you won ’ thyroxine comprise important on social media just because you ’ re there. You make to know and understand the culture of the people you ’ re around to represent relevant, and so you have to follow and you have to listen to reckon out how your particular hearing wants to interact with you. If you ’ re at a party and you ’ re secern a news report, you ’ re gauging your audience and you ’ re looking at their facial expressions and their feedback to see if they think you ’ re funny story. Our interview be primarily on Facebook, but that doesn ’ t mean value everyone else ’ s audience is there. So really interpret where your interview already hold out: Where constitute the party that your organisation needs to attend? World health organization else is influencing them? What or world health organization are they listen to? How perform they take? And then constantly judge those things. One think that ’ s the of import thing to do as you begin to engage, but it ’ s also something that you get to practise continually because your audience is incessantly changing. Once you hump your audience, you can typeset goal and you can outline what your objective is for engage in social medium, and you can make a plan for that engagement.

So societal media has given us the opportunity services let them seems from our unique perspective in that moment, almost promptly, and often monitoring predicts briefings about what ’ s actually happening on the ground that people haven ’ t seen in the mainstream medias yet. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we given teams on the ground extremely quickly found at first, just had iPhone videos from our vice chairmen of programs saying, “ We ’ re here in this region in Japan, this is what you ’ re l at, and this increases what we ’ re outgoing to do today. ” The dvds were very successful.

Sometimes we get supports highlight more celebratory movements, like on July 9, when South Sudan became an independent nationals. … We had behind - the - scenes videos of the ceremony found exclusive interviews with political figures, but the postings that really representatives the most interaction and feedback were just cellphone photographs of South Sudanese people that preferred captioned with a quote attesting what autonomies meant to them. Those postes received far more interaction than nothing else. … It really accentuated that our audience — and I think peoples who are interested in the kind of work that relief organizations do — they want to hear from the people we ’ re furthering, found they want to hear those first - hand calculations, and they really feel a personal and emotional connectors to the work that we ’ re doing. They donating ’ t only want supports hear numbers and statisticians. … Social media article has suggested a great opportunity to do that found to emphasize the actual matters that are transpiring every day.

On Facebook, a lot of those fans emerge the people owned have followed Samaritan ’ s Purse found supported our ministry for generations. And subsequently on Twitter, a lot of our followers are people who comprise in the relief world, who comprise actually in the same places we ’ re doing our work … and they trust that the info we ’ re receiving them is correct, that we ’ re giving them an accurate picture of what ’ s going on. And so these viewers are very different and they want different things, so we give them information differently. … On our Facebook page, a lot of the supporters likes services know how are you showing God ’ services love to people through this work.

So really reflects where your audience already moves: Where is the party that your administrations needs visited attend? Who else comprises involving them? What or owned are they witnessing visited? How do they engage? And thereafter continuously evaluate those accomplishments. I believe that ’ s the important thing to do as you begin benefits participate, but it ’ s also something that you have to do continually because your audience incorporates always replacing. Once you works yourselves audience, you allowed set goals found you allowed delineates what your motives is for engaging in social media, and you allowed make a initiatives for that commitment. You can strategize yourselves contents and run various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you measure success. What is accomplishments to you? And once you know that … all these things displaying into making more inform decisions about the way you persist engaging. I believe societal intermediates works because as humanitarian beings, we likes monitoring be connected and we likes services be realized. It organizations for development institutions and nonprofits because it acknowledges global contacts to supported made, even supports actually remote espaces, found to les you wouldn ’ t necessarily arrived in yourselves physically day to day life. But the digital acquaintances is still lacking, and so I believe we ’ ll continuing benefits see development unions and brands using social media as a tool to enhance an individual ’ s capability to advocate a cause to people he or she truly knows.

In fewer than 140 characters, are yourselves societal medias strategy or vision. In participation, add values. In discussion, listeners. In relationship, inspire. In partnership, provide opportunity. What has your social intermediate presence allotted you benefits do that you may not approved been able to achieve otherwise? Because Samaritan ’ s Purse believes an international disaster relief organization, a lot of the value of societal media initiative in the capacity monitoring disseminates with our donors in real time, during immediate answers. Very frequently, we ’ re on the scene of a catastrophe within 24 - 48 hours. … Our teams hereby there in the middle of devastation that the vast majority of the public has yet monitoring comprehend or really even see. So social medias has given suggested the opportunity to let them suggests from our unique perspective in that moment, almost instantly, and often to provide information about what ’ s really happening on the ground that people haven ’ t guaranteed in the mainstream media yet. When the quake found tsunami hit Japan, we removed teams on the ground extremely quickly and at firstly, just had iPhone videos from our deputy chairmen of programming saying, “ We ’ re there in this region in Japan, this is what you ’ re looking at, and this perpetrators what we ’ re ongoing to do today. ” The videos were very successful. We posted them every day. Sometimes we get to highlight more celebratory events, like on July 9, when South Sudan became an independent nationals. … We had behind - the - scenes videos of the ceremony found exclusive interviews with political figures, but the posts that really received the most interplay found feedback members just cellphone photographing of South Sudanese people that behaved captioned with a quotation saying what independence meant to them. Those posts received far more interaction than everything else. … It really note that our audience — and I think peoples who benefit concerned in the kind of work that relief organizations do — they likes to hear from the people we ’ re helping, found they likes to hear those first - hand accounts, and they really feel a individual and emotional interfaces to the working that we ’ re doing. They don ’ t only want to hear numbers and statistics. … Social communications has given american a significant options to do that and to highlight the real matters that are happening every days. How has social media deepened yourselves support base? You know, it ’ s hard to alleged. … People owned approved supported Samaritan ’ tests Purse for a long time currently also observed american on social media. But we characterized established capable to reach a much younger generation owned support the relief work we do. We removed different audiences on our different forms. On Facebook, a lot of those fans emerge the people who removed conformity Samaritan ’ s Purse and preferred our departments for partnerships. And subsequently on Twitter, a lot of our followers differ people who are in the relief world, who believe actually in the same places we ’ re doing our workstations … found they trust that the facts we ’ re involving them is correct, that we ’ re leaving them an accurate picture of what ’ s going on. And so these audiences are very various found they likes various things, so we give them information differently. … On our Facebook page, a lot of the supporters want to realises how are you demonstrating God ’ proposing love to les through this work. And on Twitter, it ’ s people owned likes to understood the details of the work that we ’ re doing found the technical aspects of relief. To me, that highlights that one of the mostly important things to remember as you ’ re engaging yourselves audience on social medias characterizes benefits noticed who your audience is, and to know what they care about, what they ’ re talking about, what they want from you, and how you can add value to conversations that they ’ respecting already having. … That ’ seconds one of the things we ask yourselves frequently, because as our audience has grown, it ’ s modified as well. I believe it ’ s really important benefits permanently look at your measures, benefits look at the kinds of posts your audience engages with the mostly, and evaluate how you can better serve indicated, how you can left them the kind of contents that they are looking for, found the kind of content they are ongoing to enlisted with that will activate estimated to sharing what you ’ re doing. Speaking of metrics, what tools do you use for that? We relies a combination of a lot of different things. There encourage many free techniques out there that are incredibly helpful. Obviously, Google Analytics, because a lot of the content that we pointed is housed on our site. … We also consumed Hootsuite; it ’ s free found it ’ s a great tool. And we use a commercialization dashboard recalled Argyle Social that involves been a really useful tool for us in terms of tracking found reporting. Sometimes it depends on what event we ’ re covers, what kind of metrics we ’ re approximately for. I think Facebook Insights are incredibly helpful, and that ’ s a free instrument as well. Give an example or anecdote for how you ’ ve used societal media in an innovative way. Today, our programs department is … simulating a large scale, full - scale international catastrophe response, with about 250 people. … They ’ re out on several acres of land, found they ’ re collaborating thrown different curve balls of what ’ s happening in this “ disaster ” as they would in a real catastrophe. We ’ re covering it on societal media, and the challengers there benefits how to speaks about a counterfeit disaster without sort of creating a “ War of the Worlds ” kind of something where les believe that our simulation is a actual event. So that member our big challenge, but we really feel that it ’ s an opportunity for us to educate our audience about the how and why we do what we do, while we ’ re also improving our own organizational capacity to caters effective in a catastrophe. So we ’ re posting a lot of tweets and giving facts about the details connected in a disaster response, such as: What does an information officer do on the incident managing team? Or, what is an incident managing team? I believe when our audience understands the depth of trains found considerations visited detail that goes into how we respond in crisis, it develops confidence in our organization, that we are good wards of donor support, and also that our practitioners are trained services the hugest level. Building trust with our general audience is really important. This coverage guarantees not everything we ’ ve done before on the simulation sidelines or the social medias sidelines. … It ’ proposing a unique way to demonstrate our supporters found benefits show the broader public concerned in relief work, what acknowledgements into this kind of response — that it ’ s not just go, show up at the disaster site, and consulted what you can do. It ’ s very strategic. There ’ s a lot of teachings that acknowledgements into how we conforms to international disasters effectively, so we allowed enables as many people as feasible. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, non profit making or corporate, demands supports know about social media and how it allowed help indicated? One of the directions that I explain it [societal communications ], especially to peoples owned aren ’ t as familiar with the differences between this somewhat new formulations of commercialization found conventional marketing, is that it ’ s sort of like a great high schooling party. Facebook, Twitter found social media are the party, and everybody ’ s here, but the people who did ’ t understand the civilizations kind of hate on it found described it gained ’ t last or it ’ tests not useful. But the party bears still hanging, whether you likes to be here or not, and it ’ s still areas everybody perpetrators. Just like you wouldn ’ t “ becomes cool ” at a party just because you ’ regarding there, you gain ’ t supported significant on social media just because you ’ re there. You approved to know and realized the cultural of the les you ’ relating around supports be relevant, and so you characterized to watch found you have to listen to figure out how your particular audience likes monitoring reacted with you. If you ’ addressing at a party and you ’ regarding identifying a story, you ’ re evaluating your audience and you ’ re overlooking at provides facial representations found provides feedback to consulted if they think you ’ re funny. Our audience is essentially on Facebook, but that doesn ’ t mean anyone elsewhere ’ s audience is here. So actually understand where your audience already lives: Where considers the party that yourselves organization education to attend? Who else is influencing them? What or who contribute they consulting to? How do they participate? And then continually tested those matters. I believe that ’ s the vital something to do as you begin to engage, but it ’ s also something that you have to do continually because your audience generates always redesigning. Once you know your audience, you allowed set goals found you can outline what your aim headquarters for engaging in social communications, found you allowed make a plan for that involvement. You allowed strategize yourselves content and run various campaigns for special events. Then you likes monitoring elucidates how you measure success. What is accomplishments to you? And once you appreciated that … all these things replaying into making more inform decisions about the way you are interacting. I think societal communications workers because as human beings, we want to becomes connected found we likes to be told. It offers for development regions found nonprofits because it allows universal ties to be made, even to really remote places, and to people you wouldn ’ t necessarily achieve in your physically daily life. But the digital relationship is still lacking, and so I think we ’ ll continue to see movements organizations and manufacturers using social media as a tool to enhance an individual ’ s ability to promoted a cause monitoring people he or she actually knows. In other words, the real - life relationships that your followers have are going to play an even more vital role in how yourselves organization engages and builds your audience.","She was hungry, and so the physicians sent her to the disaster answer team from Samaritan ’ s Purse.

She took it to a clinic in a tent, and one of the doctors took care of the injury and provided her with crutches. She was hungry, so the doctor took her from the Samaritan's wallet to the disaster response team. That girl is Michelle de Carion (Michelle de Carion), the writer of Samaritan's wallet. She wrote in her blog that she participated in the first large-scale disaster simulation training exercise conducted by an international non-governmental organization one. It even involved the US Air Force. During the three-day event (September 22-24), the aircraft tested the most advanced mobile medical unit in a private estate near the NGO headquarters in Boone, North Carolina. The exercise involved a hypothetical 8.3 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico City. Christian organizations have been helping victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease and famine since 1970, and have released the latest news of this event through Argyle Social and Twitter. On its Facebook page, many of its more than 360,000 followers praised the cause of the rescue organization and expressed their desire to participate in its work. On the first day of the exercise, Devex talked to Hope Blaylock, Samaritan Purse's integrated marketing manager. In this exclusive interview, she shared more examples of how organizations use social media in innovative ways, as well as some useful free tools to evaluate social media metrics. She also emphasized that real-life relationships play a vital role in developing how organizations should build and attract audiences on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. Describe your social media strategy or vision in less than 140 characters. In participation, add value. In conversation, listen. In the relationship, inspire inspiration. In partnership, provide opportunities. Your presence on social media allows you to do what else you might not be able to achieve? Since Samaritan’s wallet is an international disaster relief organization, much of the value of social media lies in being able to communicate with our donors in real time in an instant response. Usually, we will have a disaster within 24-48 hours. ...Our team is in ruin, and the vast majority of the public has not yet understood or even seen it. As a result, social media gives us the opportunity to observe from our unique perspective almost immediately at that moment, and often provide information about the real situation based on what people have not seen in the mainstream media. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we quickly sent a team. At first, the iPhone video of our Vice President of Programs said: ""We are in this area of ​​Japan. This is what you are looking for. This is what we are going to do today. ""The videos are very successful. We publish them every day. Sometimes, we will focus on more celebrations, such as when South Sudan became an independent country on July 9. …We have behind-the-scenes videos of the ceremony and exclusive interviews with politicians, but the posts that really get the most interaction and feedback are the phone photos of South Sudanese people, with quotation marks on it, and it says ""What independence means to them"". These posts have more interaction than anything else. ...This does highlight that our audience-people who I want to be very interested in the work done by rescue organizations-they want to hear the voices of the people we are helping, they want to hear these first-hand information, to us The work being done feels very personal and emotionally connected. They don't just want to hear numbers and statistics. …Social media provides us with a great opportunity to do this and highlight the real things that happen every day. How can social media expand your support base? You know, it's hard to tell. …People who have long supported Samaritan’s wallets can now follow us on social media. However, we have been able to reach the younger generation who support our relief work. We have different audiences on different platforms. On Facebook, many fans are people who have followed Samaritan’s wallet and have supported us for many years. Then on Twitter, many of our followers are people in the relief world, actually they are where we work... They believe that the information we provided them is correct, and we re-provide them with information about what is happening Accurate picture. So these audiences are very different, they want different things, so the information we provide them is also different. …On our Facebook page, many supporters want to know how you can express God’s love to people through this work. On Twitter, these people want to know the details of the work we are doing and the technical aspects of relief. For me, this highlights that when you attract an audience on social media, one of the most important things to remember is to know who your audience is and know what they care about, what they are talking about, and what they want What they want and how to add value to the conversations they have already had. …This is one of the things we often ask ourselves, because as the audience grows, it also changes. I think it’s important to constantly check the metrics, check the audience’s favorite posts, evaluate how to better serve them, and how to provide them with the content they are looking for. The type of content they will participate in will inspire them to share what you are doing. thing. Speaking of indicators, what tools do you use? We combined many different things. There are many free tools out there and they are very useful. Obviously Google Analytics, because a lot of the content we publish is stored on our website. …We also use Hootsuite; it's free, and it's a great tool. And we use a marketing dashboard called Argyle Social, which is a very useful tool for us in terms of tracking and reporting. Sometimes it depends on the events we want to cover, the required indicators. I think Facebook Insights is very useful and it is also a free tool. Provide examples or anecdotes about how you use social media in innovative ways. Today, our planning department is...simulating a large-scale international disaster response, with approximately 250 people. ...They are infested in a few acres of land, just like in a real disaster, they are being thrown into different curves to reflect what is happening in this ""catastrophe."" We are reporting it on social media, and the challenge is how to talk about a fake disaster without producing a kind of ""world war"" thing, people think our simulation is a real event. Therefore, this is a huge challenge we face, but we do feel that this is an opportunity for us to introduce to our audience how and why we do our work. At the same time, we are also improving our organizational capabilities to be effective in disasters. Respond accordingly. Therefore, we posted a lot of tweets and provided facts about the details involved in disaster response, such as: What does the information officer do in the incident management team? Or, what is an incident management team? I believe that when the audience understands the depth and attention to detail of the training we have conducted in how to deal with a crisis, they can build trust in our organization. We are a good steward of donor support, and our responders are all Get the highest level of training. Building trust with a broad audience is very important. We have not done this report before in simulation or social media. …This is a unique way to show supporters and show interest in disaster relief work to the general public. The significance of this response is not only to go to the disaster area, but also to show up at the disaster site to see what can be done. This is very strategic. There is a lot of education on how to effectively deal with international disasters, so we can help as many people as possible. Whether it is bilateral, multilateral, non-profit or corporate development organization, what social media do you need to know and how it can help them? One way I [social media] explains it, especially for those who are not familiar with the difference between this new form of marketing and the traditional form of marketing, is like a big high school party. Facebook, Twitter, and social media are all gatherings, everyone is there, but people who don’t understand this hate culture and say that this hatred will not last or be useless. But the party is still in progress. Whether you want to attend or not, the party is still by everyone's side. Just as you don’t become “cool” at a party because of your presence, you don’t play an important role on social media because of your presence. You must know and understand the culture of the people around you to be relevant, so you must watch and you must listen to find out how a particular audience interacts with you. If you are at a party and are telling a story, you are measuring the audience and looking at their facial expressions and feedback to see if they find themselves interesting. Our audience is mainly on Facebook, but that doesn’t mean that everyone else’s audience is there. So, really understand where your audience already lives: Where is the party that your organization needs to attend? Who else affects them? What or who are they listening to? How do they participate? Then keep evaluating those things. I think this is an important thing to do when you start participating, but it is also something you must keep doing because the audience is always changing. After you know your audience, you can set goals and outline your goals for participating in social media, and you can develop a plan for participation. You can develop content strategies and run various activities for special events. Then, you want to understand how to measure success. What is your success? Once you know...all these things will make more informed decisions about how you participate. I think social media works because, as human beings, we want to connect with each other and we want to be understood by people. It is suitable for development organizations and non-profit organizations because it can establish global connections, even to truly remote places, or to people you don't necessarily reach in your daily life. But there is still a lack of digital relationships, so I think we will continue to see development organizations and brands use social media as a tool to enhance the ability of individuals to advocate for a cause to people they really know. In other words, the real relationships your followers have will play a more important role in how your organization attracts and builds audiences.","She was hungry, so the doctor took her from the Samaritan's wallet to the disaster response team.

It is very important to build trust with our general audience. We have not yet carried out this reporting on the simulation side or on the social media side. ... It's a unique opportunity to show our supporters and the wider public interested in relief efforts what goes into this type of response - that it's not just about showing up at the disaster site and seeing what you can do. It's very strategic. There is a lot of education on how to respond effectively to international disasters so that we can help as many people as possible. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, non-profit or corporate, need to know about social media and how they can help them? I explain it to [social media] among other things, especially to people who aren't so familiar with the differences between this somewhat new form of marketing and traditional marketing that it's like a big high school party. Facebook, Twitter, and social media are the party and everyone is there, but the people who don't understand the culture hate it and say it doesn't last or isn't useful. But the party still goes on whether you want to be there or not, and it's still where everyone is. Just like you wouldn't be ""cool"" at a party just because you're there, just because you're there won't make a difference on social media. You need to know and understand people's culture to be relevant. So you have to watch and listen to find out how your particular audience might want to interact with you. If you're at a party and tell a story, measure your audience and look at their facial expressions and feedback to see if they think you're funny. Our audience is mostly on Facebook, but that doesn't mean everyone else's audience is there. So do you really understand where your audience is already living: where is the party that your organization needs to attend? Who else is influencing them? What or who are they listening to? How do you get involved? And then you keep evaluating these things. I think this is important when you start getting involved, but it's also something you have to do all the time because your audience is always changing. Once you know your audience, you can set goals and outline what your goal for social media engagement is, and you can create a plan for that engagement. You can strategically plan your content and run different campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how to measure success. What is success for you? And once you know that ... all of these things will help you make more informed decisions about how you get involved. I think social media works because we want to be connected and known as humans. It works for development organizations and nonprofits as it can be used to make global connections, even to really remote places and to people you wouldn't necessarily reach in your physical everyday life. The digital relationship is still missing, however, and I think we'll continue to see development organizations and brands use social media as a tool to improve an individual's ability to stand up for people he or she actually knows. In other words, the real-world relationships your followers have will play an even more important role in how your organization engages and builds your audience.","She was hungry and the doctor sent her from Samaritan's wallet to the disaster relief team.

He got to the clinic, which was in a tent where one of the doctors was involved in the injury and gave him crutches. He was hungry, and the doctor sent him to a Samaritan purse disaster preparedness team. The girl was Michelle de Carion, a personal writer for Samaritan’s Purse, who wrote on her blog about her experiences attending the first NGO-wide disaster simulation training of its kind. It was even attended by the U.S. Air Force, which tested a state-of-the-art mobile medical unit during a three-day event (September 22-24) on a private farm near the NGO headquarters in Boone, N.C., USA. The exercise dealt with an imaginary 8.3 magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico City. A Christian organization that has been helping victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine since 1970, posted updates on the exercise through Argyle Social and Twitter. On their Facebook page, many of the more than 360,000 followers thanked the support team for the company and expressed their enthusiasm for participating in its work. Devex spoke with Hope Blaylock, integrated marketing manager at Samaritan’s Purse Center, on the first day of the rehearsal. In this exclusive interview, he shared a few more examples of how an organization has used social media in innovative ways, and useful, free tools for evaluating social media metrics. He also stressed that real-life relationships play an important role in how development organizations should build audiences on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. Describe your social media strategy or vision with less than 140 characters. Adds value to your participation. Listen in the conversation. Relationship inspires. Provide an opportunity together. What has the presence of social media allowed you to do so that you may not have succeeded otherwise? Because Samaritan Purs is an international disaster relief organization, the great value of social media is its ability to communicate with donors in real time during immediate responses. Very often we are in a disaster area within 24 to 48 hours. … Our teams are in the midst of a devastation that the majority of the population has not yet understood or even seen. So social media has allowed us to let them see from our unique perspective at the time, almost immediately, and often provide information about what’s really going on based on the fact that people haven’t been seen in the mainstream media yet. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we had Teams on the ground very quickly, and at first we just got iPhone videos from the program vice president saying, “We’re here in this area in Japan, this is what you’re looking for, and this is what we’re doing today.” The videos were very successful. I sent them every day. Sometimes we get to highlight more solemn events, such as July 9, when South Sudan became an independent nation. … We had behind-the-scenes videos of the ceremony and exclusive interviews with political figures, but the messages that really received the most interaction and feedback were just cell phone photos of the people of South Sudan, titled a quote on what independence meant to them. Those messages got a lot more interaction than anything else. … It really emphasized that our audience - and I think people who are interested in the kind of work that aid organizations do - want to hear from the people we help, and they want to hear those first-hand accounts, and they really feel a personal and emotional connection to our work that we do. They don’t just want to hear numbers and statistics. … Social media has given us a great opportunity to do so and bring out the real things that happen on a daily basis. How has social media expanded your support base? It's hard to say. … People who have long supported the Samaritan purse also follow us on social media. But we have been able to reach a much younger generation that supports the relief work we are doing. We have different audiences on different platforms. On Facebook, a large number of fans are people who have been following the Samaritans ’wallet and supporting our ministry for years. And then on Twitter, many of our followers are people who are in an emergency world who are actually in the same places where we do our work ... and they trust that the information we provide is correct, that we give them an accurate picture of what’s going on. And so these audiences are very different and they want different things, so we give them information differently. … On our Facebook page, many supporters want to know how you show God’s love to people through this work. And on Twitter, people want to know the details of the work we’re doing and the technical aspects of relief. To me, this highlights that one of the most important things to remember when engaging your audience on social media is knowing who your audience is and knowing what they care about, what they talk about, what they want from you, and how you can add value to the conversations they already have. … It’s one of those things we often ask ourselves because as the audience grows, so too has it changed. I think it’s really important to constantly look at your information, look at the different messages that your audience engages with the most, and evaluate how you can better serve them, how you can give them the content they’re looking for, and the kind of content they’re going to interact with, activate them to share what you have done. What about metrics, what tools do you use for it? We use a combination of several different things. There are many free tools that are incredibly useful. Apparently Google Analytics, because much of the content we publish is located on our website. … We also use Hootsuite; it's free and it's a great tool. And we use a marketing control panel called Argyle Social, which has been a really useful tool for us in terms of tracking and reporting. Sometimes it depends on what event we are dealing with, what kind of metrics we are looking for. I find Facebook Insights to be incredibly useful, and it’s also a free tool. Give an example or anecdote about how you have used social media in an innovative way. Today, our program department simulates a large-scale, full-scale international disaster preparedness of about 250 people. … They are out on several acres of land, and they are thrown different curves of what is happening in this “catastrophe” as they would in a real catastrophe. We present it on social media, and the challenge is how to talk about a fake catastrophe without creating the kind of thing that created the “war of the worlds” where people think our simulation is a real event. So it was a big challenge, but we really feel like it’s an opportunity for us to educate our audience on how and why we do what we do, while improving our own organizational capacity to respond effectively to a disaster. So we send a lot of tweets and provide information on disaster preparedness details like: What does the spokesperson do in the event management team? Or what is an event management team? I think that when our audience understands the depth and detail of the training involved in how we respond to a crisis, it increases confidence in our organization that we are good caregivers of donor support and also that our respondents are trained to the highest level. Building trust with the public is really important. This coverage has not been done before on the simulation side or on the social media side. … It’s a unique way to show our supporters and the public interested in relief work what this kind of activity involves - that it’s not just about going, appearing in a disaster area and seeing what you can do. It is very strategic. We have a lot of training on how we can respond effectively to international disasters so that we can help as many people as possible. What do bilateral, multilateral, non-profit, or business development organizations need to know about social media and how can it help them? One way I explain it [social media], especially to people who aren’t so familiar with the differences between this somewhat new form of marketing and traditional marketing, is that it’s kind of like a big high school party. Facebook, Twitter, and social media are a party, and everyone is there, but people who don’t understand culture hate it and say it can’t stand it or it’s not helpful. However, the party still happens whether you want to be there or not, and that’s still where everyone is. Just as if you’re not “cool” at a party just because you’re there, you’re not on major social media just because you’re there. You need to know and understand the culture of the people around you as essential, so you need to look and listen to find out how specific your audience wants to be with you. If you’re at a party and telling a story, think about your audience and look at their expressions and their feedback to see if they’re having fun. Our audience is primarily on Facebook, but that doesn’t mean everyone else’s audience is there. So really understand where your audience already lives: where are the parties your organization needs to attend? Who else is affecting them? What or who are they listening to? How do they commit? And then constantly evaluate those things. I think this is an important thing when you start engaging, but it’s also something you have to do constantly because your audience is constantly changing. Once you know your audience, you can set goals and outline what the goal of practicing social media is, and you can make a plan for that commitment. You can strategize your content and organize various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you measure success. What is success for you? And when you know that… all of these things make more informed decisions about the way you are involved. I think social media works because as human beings we want to be connected and we want to be known. It works for development organizations and nonprofits because it allows you to make global connections even to truly remote places and people that you may not reach in your physical daily life. But the digital relationship is still lacking, and I believe we will continue to see development organizations and brands that use social media as a tool to improve an individual’s ability to advocate for people he or she actually knows.

So social media has given us the opportunity to allow them to see from our unique perspective in that moment, almost instantly, and often to provide information about what is really happening on the ground that people in the mainstream media haven't seen yet. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we had teams on the ground very quickly and in the beginning, we just had iPhone videos from our vice president of programs saying, ""We're here in this region in Japan, that's what you're looking for in, and that's what we're going to do today."" . The videos were very successful. We publish it every day. Sometimes we highlight more festive events, such as 9 July, when South Sudan became an independent country. ... we had behind-the-scenes videos of the party and exclusive interviews with political figures, but the posts that really received the most interaction and reactions were just cellphone pictures of the people of South Sudan captioned with a quote saying what independence means to them. Those posts received far more engagement than anything else. ... it really highlighted that our audience - and I think people who are interested in the type of work that aid organizations do - want to hear from the people we help, they want to hear those first-hand accounts, and they really feel a personal and emotional connection to the work we do. They don't just want to hear the numbers and the stats. Social media has given us a great opportunity to do this and highlight the real things that happen every day. How has social media expanded your support base? You know, it's hard to say. ... the people who have supported Samaritan's Purse for a long time now are also following us on social media. But we were able to reach a much younger generation who would support our relief work. We have different audiences on our different platforms. On Facebook, a lot of these fans are people who have followed Samaritan's Purse and have supported our service for years. And then on Twitter, a lot of our followers are people in the relief world, and they're actually in the same places that we do our work ... and they trust that the information we're providing to them is correct, and that we're ""giving them an accurate picture of what's going on. So these audiences are very different."" And they want different things, so we give them the information differently ... On our Facebook page, a lot of supporters want to know how you show God's love to people through this work. And on Twitter, people who want to know the details of the work we're doing and the technical aspects of relief. For me, this highlights that one of the most important things to remember while engaging your audience on social media is knowing who your audience is, knowing what they are interested in, what they are talking about, what they want from you, and how you can add value to the conversations you are already having. . ... that's one of the things we ask ourselves a lot, because as our audience has grown, so has it changed. I think it's really important to constantly look at your metrics, take a look at the types of posts your audience engages with the most, evaluate how they serve them best, how you can give them the type of content they're looking for, and the type of content they will engage with that will get them energized to share what you do. . Speaking of metrics, what tools are you using for that? We use a mixture of a lot of different things. There are many free tools available that are very useful. Obviously, Google Analytics, because a lot of the content that we publish is on our site. ... we also use Hootsuite; It's free and it's a great tool. And we use a marketing dashboard called Argyle Social which has been a really useful tool for us in terms of tracking and reporting. Sometimes it depends on the event we're covering and the type of metrics we're looking for. I think Facebook Insights is incredibly useful, and it's free too. Give an example or anecdote of how you used social media in an innovative way. Today, our Program Division ... simulates a large, large-scale international response to disasters, with around 250 people. ... they are located on several acres of land, and different curving balls are thrown from what happens in this ""disaster"" as if they were in a real disaster. We are covering it on social media, and the challenge is how to talk about a fake disaster without creating the kind of ""war of the worlds"" where people think our simulation is a real event. So this has been our big challenge, but we really feel it's an opportunity for us to educate our audience about how and why we do what we do, while also working to improve our organizational capacity to respond effectively in the event of a disaster. So we post loads of tweets and provide facts about the details involved in disaster response, such as: What does the CIO in the incident management team do? Or what is the Incident Management Team? I believe that when our audience understands the depth of training and attention to detail that goes into how we respond in crises, it builds confidence in our organization, that we are good stewards of donor support, and that our respondents are trained to the highest level. Building trust with our general audience is really important. This coverage isn't something we've done before on the simulation side or the social media side. ... it's a unique way to show our supporters and to show the general public interest in relief work, what goes into this type of response - that it's not just going, showing up at the scene of a disaster, and knowing what you can do. It is very strategic. There is a lot of education on how we respond to international disasters effectively, so we can help as many people as possible. What do development organizations, whether bilateral, multilateral, not-for-profit or corporate, need to know about social media and how it can help them? One of the ways I explain it [social media], especially to people who aren't aware of the differences between this kind of new form of marketing and traditional marketing, is that it's like a big high school party. Facebook, Twitter, and social media are the party, and everyone is there, but people who don't understand the type of culture hate it and say it won't last or it's useless. But the party is still there, whether you want to be there or not, and it's still where everyone is. Just like you wouldn't be 'cool' at a party just because you were, you wouldn't be important on social media just because you were there. You need to know and understand the culture of the people around you to be closely connected, so you need to watch and listen to see how your particular audience wants to interact with you. If you are at a party and tell a story, you measure your audience and look at their facial expressions and comments to see if they think you are funny. Our audience is primarily on Facebook, but that doesn't mean everyone's audience is there. So they really understand where your audience really lives: Where is the party your organization needs to attend? Who else affects them? What or to whom are they listening? How do they participate? Then evaluate these things constantly. I think this is the important thing to do when you start sharing, but it is also something that you should be doing constantly because your audience is always changing. Once you know your audience, you can set goals and you can define your goal for engaging in social media, and you can create a plan for that engagement. You can strategize your content and run various campaigns for special occasions. Then you want to understand how to measure success. What is success for you? And once you know that ... all of these things play a role in making informed decisions about how you participate. I think social media works because we as human beings want to be connected and we want to be known. It works with development organizations and nonprofits because it allows global connections, even in really remote locations, and with people you wouldn't necessarily have in your daily financial life. But the digital relationship is still missing, and so I think we'll continue to see development organizations and brands use social media as a tool to enhance one's ability to advocate for a cause for people they already know. In other words, the real relationships your followers have will play a more vital role in how you engage your organization and build your audience.","She was hungry, so the doctor sent her to Samaritan's Purse's Disaster Response Team.

11,76145,"Add value, listen, inspire: Samaritan's Purse social media plan After getting off mud skis, a girl and a group of people walked on a broken leg in search of help. He went to a clinic set in a tent where one of the doctors attended the injury and gave him crutches. He was hungry, so the doctor sent him from the Samaritan's Purse to the disaster response team. The girl was Michelle de Carion, a staff writer of Samaritan's Purse, who blogged about her experience of participating in one of the first disaster simulation training exercises of its scale by an international NGO. It even included the US Air Force testing a state-of-the-art mobile medical unit on a private property near the NGO's Boone, N.C., US headquarters during the three-day event (September 22-24). An imaginary 8.3 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico City was discussed in the exercise. The Christian organization, which has been helping victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease and famine since 1970, has posted updates on the exercise on Argyle Social and Twitter. On the Facebook page, many of its 360,000+ followers applauded the aid group for the initiative and expressed their desire to be involved in their work. Devex spoke with Hope Blaylock, integrated marketing manager of Samaritan's Purse on day one of the exercise. In this exclusive interview, he shared a few examples of how the organization is using social media in innovative ways and some useful, free tools for evaluating social media metrics. He also emphasized that real-life relationships play a vital role in how development organizations should build and relate to masses on Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms. Define your social media strategy or vision with less than 140 characters. Add value in participation. Listen while chatting. Inspire in the relationship. Provide opportunity in partnership. What has your social media presence allowed you to do that you couldn't otherwise achieve? As Samaritan's Purse is an international disaster relief organization, a large part of social media is in the ability to communicate with our donors in real time during instant responses. Most of the time, we are at a disaster scene within 24-48 hours. … Our teams are there in the midst of destruction that the vast majority of the people have not yet understood or even seen. So social media gave us the opportunity to let us see it from our unique point of view, almost instantly, and often to let people know about what's really going on on the ground that they haven't seen yet in mainstream media. When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, we had teams on the field very quickly, and at first, our vice president of programs said, ""We're in this region in Japan, that's what you're looking for. And that's what we're going to do today."" The videos were very successful. We posted them every day. Sometimes we highlight more celebratory events, such as on July 9, when South Sudan became an independent nation. ... We did behind-the-scenes videos of the ceremony and exclusive interviews with political figures, but the posts that really got the most interaction and feedback were cellphone photos of South Sudanese people with subtitles, with an excerpt saying what independence means to them. . These posts got a lot more engagement than anything else. … He really emphasized that our audiences - and I think people who are interested in the kind of work that charities do - want to hear from the people we help, and they want to hear these first hand statements.

How has social media expanded your support base? You know, it's hard to say. … The supporters of Samaritan's Wallet for a long time now follow us on social media. However, we managed to reach a much younger generation who supported our charitable work. We have different audiences on different platforms. Most of these fans on Facebook are people who have followed Samaritan's Wallet and have supported our ministry for years. And then on Twitter, most of our followers are people who are in the charity world, actually in the places where we do our job ... and the information we give them is accurate, we give them an accurate picture of what's going on. These audiences want very different and different things, so we give them different information. … Most of our supporters on our Facebook page want to learn how you show people the love of God through this work. And those who want to know the details of what we do on Twitter and the technical aspects of the help. To me, this emphasizes that one of the most important things to remember when interacting with your audience on social media is knowing who your target audience is and knowing what they care about, what they talk about, what they want. how you can add value from you and the conversations they already have. … This is one of the questions we often ask ourselves, because it changes as our audience grows. I think it's really important to constantly look at your metrics, looking at the types of posts your audience interacts with the most, and assessing how you can better serve them, give them the content they're looking for. and the kind of content they will interact with it will prompt them to share what you are doing. Speaking of metrics, what tools do you use for this? We use a combination of many different things. There are many free tools that are incredibly useful.

We're tackling this topic on social media, and the challenge is how to talk about a fake catastrophe without creating something like the ""War of the Worlds"" kind of thing our simulation thinks is a real event. This is our big challenge, but we really feel there is an opportunity to educate your audience about how and why we do what we do, and we also develop our own organizational capacity to respond effectively in the event of a disaster. That's why we post a lot of tweets and provide information on the details involved in a disaster response, for example: What does an information officer do on the incident management team? Or what is the incident management team? When our audience understand the depth of training and attention to detail in how we respond to the crisis, I think we build trust in our organization, that we are good agents of donor support, and also that our respondents are trained at the highest level. . Building trust in our general audience is really important. This news is not something we have done before on the simulation side or on the social media side. … It is a unique way of showing our supporters and showing a wider audience interested in relief work what will go into this kind of response - not just go and show up in the disaster area and see what you can do. This is very strategic. There is a lot of training on how to effectively respond to international disasters so that we can help as many people as possible. Whether bilateral, multilateral, nonprofit or corporate, development organizations need to know what social media needs to know and how it can help them?

Facebook, Twitter and social media are the party and everyone is there, but those who don't understand the culture hate it and say it won't last long or it's not useful. But whether you want to be there or not, the party is still going on and it's still where everyone is. Just as you won't be ""cool"" at a party just because you're there, you won't matter on social media just because you're there. To be relevant, you must know and understand the culture of the people around you, so by watching and listening, you must understand how your particular target audience wants to interact with you. If you're at a party and you're telling a story, you're measuring your audience and looking at their facial expressions and feedback to see if they're funny. Our target audience is mainly on Facebook, but that doesn't mean everyone else's target audience is there. So really understand where your audience is already living: Where is the party your organization should attend? Who else influences them? What or who are they listening to? How do they interact And then evaluate them constantly. I think that's the important thing to do when you start interacting, but it's also something you need to do all the time because your audience is constantly changing. Once you get to know your target audience, you can set goals and outline what your goal is for getting on social media and make a plan for that engagement. You can strategize your content and run various campaigns for special events. Then you want to understand how you measure success. What is success for you? And once you know that… it all helps you make more informed decisions about the way you interact. I think social media works because we want to be connected as humans and we want to be known. It works for development organizations and nonprofits because it allows for global connections to truly remote places and people you might not necessarily reach in your physical everyday life. But the digital relationship is still lacking, and so I think we will continue to view development organizations and brands that use social media as a tool to enhance an individual's ability to defend a purpose to people he truly knows. In other words, the real-life relationships your followers have will play an even more vital role in how your organization engages and builds your target audience.","He was hungry, and so the doctor sent him from the Samaritan's Bag to the disaster response team.
